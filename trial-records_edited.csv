NCT02660099,,Internet Delivered Cognitive Behavior Therapy for Obsessive-compulsive Disorder in Adolescents With Autism Spectrum Disorder - A Clinical Case Series,24949622,BiP-ASD/OCD,,7-Jul-15,,,,,,Jun-16,,Completed,Internet Delivered CBT for OCD in Adolescents With ASD - A Clinical Case Series,The aim of this study is to test the feasibility and acceptability of an internet-delivered cognitive behavior therapy (ICBT) intervention originally developed for neurotypical adolescents with obsessive compulsive disorder (OCD) in adolescents with OCD and autism spectrum disorder (ASD). This feasibility study will inform us how to adapt the original intervention to the specific needs of patients with ASD.,"To evaluate the effectiveness of ICBT for OCD in adolescents with ASD, this study will use a single case experimental design with weekly measures during two phases: A-B. The A-phase will consist of baseline measures at least three weeks prior to treatment. The B-phase will consist of the 12 weeks ICBT-program as well as one measure post-treatment. Single case descriptions of each participant will be presented. Weekly measures on the Obsessional Compulsive Inventory - Child version (OCI-CV) will be analyzed through visual inspection of each participants graph and through computation of Percentage of Non-overlapping Data (PND). PND is a frequently used effect measure in SCED and reflects how large percentage of the measurements during the treatment-phase that do not overlap with any of the measurements during the base-line phase. To assess the feasibility and comprehension of the ICBT treatment semi-structured interviews (face-to-face or telephone) will be conducted with participants and parents weekly during the four first weeks of ICBT and semi-weekly during the rest of the treatment. Detailed notes will be taken during each interview and will serve as content material for a thematic analysis trying to determine possible accommodations to the ICBT protocol to better suit patients with ASD.",Interventional,N/A,N/A,,,Single Group Assignment,,Treatment,None (Open Label),,Obsessive Compulsive Disorder; Autism Spectrum Disorder,Behavioral,Internet-delivered Cognitive Behavior Therapy,,Internet-delivered CBT,,,,"Inclusion Criteria: - a diagnosis of OCD as defined by DSM-5 [40] - a diagnosis of autism defined by DSM-5 - a total score of ≥ 16 on the Children's Yale-Brown Obsessive-Compulsive Scale, CY-BOCS [14] - age between 12 and 17 years - ability to read and write Swedish - access to the internet - a parent that is able to co-participate in the treatment - Participants on psychotropic medication must have been on a stable dose for the last 6 weeks prior to baseline assessment Exclusion Criteria: - psychosis or bipolar disorder, severe eating disorder - suicidal ideation - subject not able to read or understand the basics of the ICBT material - completed CBT for OCD within last 12 months (defined as at least 5 sessions of CBT including exposure and response prevention) - ongoing psychological treatment for OCD or another anxiety disorder",All,12 Years,17 Years,Accepts Healthy Volunteers,,4,,"Obsessional Compulsive Inventory - Child version, OCI-CV",Change from baseline to 12 weeks,Self-rated OCD symptom levels,"Children's Yale Brown Obsessive Compulsive Scale; Mini International Neuropsychiatric Interview for Children and Adolescents, MINI-KID; Clinical Global Impression - Severity, CGI-S; Clinical Global Impression - Improvement, CGI-I; Children's Global Assessment Scale, CGAS; Children´s Depression Inventory - Short version; Strength and difficulties, SDQ; Family Accommodation Scale, Parent-Report, FAS-PR; Patient ICBT Adherence Rating, PIAR; Education, Work and Social Adjustment Scale - child and parent version, EWSAS",Change from baseline to 12 weeks; Baseline; Change from baseline to 12 weeks; Post treatment(12 weeks); Change from baseline to 12 weeks; Change from baseline to 12 weeks; Change from baseline to 12 weeks; Change from baseline to 12 weeks; after 6 weeks and at post treatment(12 weeks); Change from baseline to 12 weeks,Clinician-rated OCD symptom levels; psychiatric screening of comorbidity; Global symptom levels; Global symptom improvement; Global level of functioning; Symptom level of depressive mood; General psychopathology; Parental accommodation to OCD symptoms; Patient Adherence to internet delivered CBT; Global functioning,,,,Internet-delivered CBT,Experimental,12 weeks of internet-delivered cognitive behavior therapy provided through a secure internet platform and online clinician contact,,Karolinska Institutet; Karolinska insititute,Stockholm; Stockholm,Sweden; Sweden,Undecided,Undecided,,,,,,Principal Investigator; Karolinska Institutet; Eva Serlachius; Research director,Karolinska Institutet,Other,,,"David Mataix-Cols, Professor",Principal Investigator,"Department of Clinical Neuroscience, Karolinska Institutet",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Mon Apr 11 14:56:56 2022

To date there are no effective treatments for ME/CFS as the ethology and pathophysiology are unknown, while levels of functioning and quality of life as well as secondary effects such as depressive and anxiety symptoms indicate a highly affected patient population. As such, there is a need for behavior medicine approaches that aim to alleviate suffering and promote increases in quality of life for these patients. The aim of the present study is to do a preliminary evaluation of the safety, acceptability and efficacy of an ACT-based treatment protocol for ME/CFS. An additional aim is to explore potential mediators of change for the effect of treatment on disability.","Background Medical strategies alone appear insufficient to increase functioning and quality of life in ME/CFS. Cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) is the only treatment approach with preliminary evidence of efficacy for improving functioning and quality of life. However, effect sizes are generally modest. Behavior medicine treatment approaches based on Acceptance & Commitment Therapy (ACT) have gained increasing attention and research support within clinical trials for similar diagnoses (e.g. chronic pain, Fibromyalgia). Results from these areas illustrate the utility of this approach for individuals with somatic symptomatology. To date, the efficacy of ACT has not been evaluated for ME/CFS. Purpose The aims of this pilot study are to explore the utility of ACT and to evaluate the feasibility of the treatment model for patients with ME/CFS. Method Treatment program: 13 weekly to bi-weekly individual ACT sessions with a psychologist (10) and a physician (3) respectively. An open trial design is used, with assessments at pre-, mid- and post-treatment as well as at 3 and 6 months follow-up. Further, yearly follow-ups until 5-year follow-up are planned. Measures: History data, illness factors, psychological factors, functioning and quality of life. Patients: Consecutively recruited via referrals to a specialist treatment centre (n=40). Once patients have been found eligible and expressed interest in study participation they will be assessed by a psychologist and by a physician, via semi-structured interviews to confirm eligibility and to ensure that the patient meet the study criteria. Informed consent is obtained from all participants prior to the assessment. Statistical analysis: Evaluations of treatment effects are primarily based on intent-to-treat analyses. The statistical approach will primarily be based on linear multilevel modeling (LMM), which takes into account dependencies between repeated measures and differences between patients in pre-treatment status and treatment response (i.e. random effects modeling) and also provide means of handling missing data.",Interventional,N/A,N/A,,,Single Group Assignment,Open case trial,Treatment,None (Open Label),,Chronic Fatigue Syndrome,Behavioral,Acceptance and Commitment Therapy (ACT),,ACT,,,,"Inclusion Criteria: Subjects were included if - Referred to a specialist behavior medicine treatment unit for ME/CFS - 18 years of age or older - Fulfilling CDC ME/CFS diagnostic criteria AND 2003 clinical case definition ME/CFS diagnostic criteria - Treatment resistent symptomatology - Evident ME/CFS-related disability (assessed with self-report questionnaires and clinical interviews) - Stabile medication during the last 2 months with no planned changes during active study treatment Exclusion Criteria: Subjects were excluded if: - psychiatric or somatic comorbidity was prevalent and assessed as more primary than ME/CFS illness; - non-adherence during assessment phase; - they did not speak Swedish; - ongoing or recently (less than six months) completed CBT-oriented treatment; - other treatment than standard care (pharmacological, psychological or otherwise) planned in the coming six months",All,18 Years,N/A,No,,40,,ME/CFS Disability Index (changes between assessments); Psychological Inflexibility in Fatigue Scale (PIFS) (changes between assessments),Baseline to 6-month follow-up; Baseline to 6-month follow-up,"Self-reported ME/CFS-related disability in 7 life domains (domestic; recreational activities; social activities; occupational; sexual life; daily activities; life-sustaining activities).

Untreated anxiety often has a chronic course, or may be a recurring condition. Anxiety in children predicts a variety of psychiatric disorders later in life, and involves problems regarding school performance and social relations. The literature provides a number of factors, which are suggested to increase the risk of developing an anxiety disorder. In particular, it has been shown that children of parents with anxiety disorders are at much greater risk of developing an anxiety disorder. Several studies have found a correlation between anxiety in the child, and parent behavior characterized by criticism, control and overprotectiveness. The present study aim to preliminary evaluate whether a eight week parent training intervention can reduce the incidence of anxiety disorders in children and to evaluate the feasibility of the parent training. Three central factors has been the basis in developing the parent training, all of which are considered to be involved in the development and maintenance of anxiety disorders in children (1) criticism and rejection, (2) control and overprotectiveness, and (3) parental modeling and reinforcement of anxiety. The goal of the parent training is therefore (1) to increase warmth and acceptance, (2) to increase autonomy for the child, and (3) modeling and reinforcement of brave behavior. The investigators intend to include 60 anxious parents in the study, who will be randomly allocated to either group parent training, Internet delivered parent training, or wait-list condition. The inclusion criteria are as follows: The parent states that he/she experiences anxiety or worry, the parents' child is 6-12 years old, and do not fulfill criteria for an anxiety disorder or major depressive disorder, the parent possesses everyday access to the Internet, and there is no presence of very aggravated family situations, such as parent substance abuse or severe depression, or domestic violence.",,Interventional,N/A,Randomized,,,Parallel Assignment,,Prevention,Single (Outcomes Assessor),,Anxiety Disorders,Behavioral; Behavioral,Group parent training for anxious parents; Internet delivered parent training for anxious parents,,Group parent training; Internet delivered parent training,,,,"Inclusion Criteria: - The parent states that he/she experiences anxiety or worry, - The parents' child is 6-12 years old, and do not fulfill criteria for an anxiety disorder or major depressive disorder - The parent possesses everyday access to the Internet Exclusion Criteria: - Presence of very aggravated family situations, such as parent substance abuse or severe depression, or domestic violence.",All,N/A,N/A,Accepts Healthy Volunteers,,40,,Anxiety Disorders Interview Schedule - Child and Parent Version,At 12-month follow up,,The Spence Children's Anxiety Scale; Children Depression Inventory; The Rearing Behavior Questionnaire; Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire; State-Trait Anxiety Inventory; Montgomery-Åsberg Depression Rating Scale; Quality of Life Inventory,Change from baseline in anxiety symptom scores at 12 months follow-up; Change from baseline in depressive symptom scores at 12 months follow-up; Change from baseline in rearing behavior scores at 12 months follow-up; Change from baseline in dfficulties scores at 12 months follow-up; Change from baseline in anxiety symptom scores at 12 months follow-up; Change from baseline in depressive symptom scores at 12 months follow-up; Change from baseline in quality of life scores at 12 months follow-up,Rated by the child and the parent independently; Rated by the child; Rated by parents; Rated by parents; Rated by parents; Rated by parents; Rated by parents,,,,Group parent training; Internet delivered parent training; Wait-list,Experimental; Experimental; No Intervention,"The intervention Group parent training for anxious parents is delivered in groups of about five, in 90 minutes per session, for eight consecutive weeks.

Several studies have demonstrated the efficacy of Cognitive Behavior Therapy (CBT) for severe health anxiety, both on anxiety itself and on secondary symptom measures (for example of depression). One published randomized controlled trial (RCT) has examined the feasibility of delivering CBT for severe health anxiety via the Internet as a form of guided self help. Participants had contact with a therapist via an e-mail-like system throughout the treatment. This approach yielded results superior to a waiting-list condition, thus potentially greatly increasing the availability of psychological treatment. However, more studies on the effects of Internet-delivered CBT are warranted (NCT01673035 being one). Additionally, little is known about the active ingredients and mechanisms of change involved in Internet-delivered CBT. For example, the significance of therapist support in relation to treatment outcomes remains to be determined. CBT-based self-help literature, so called bibliotherapy, has shown great promise in the treatment of several anxiety disorders, including panic disorder and social anxiety disorder. Two small pilot studies have indicated that bibliotherapy with no or minimal therapist contact could be suitable for treating health anxiety. Aim of the study The aim of the present RCT is to compare therapist-guided Internet-delivered CBT (n=33), Internet-delivered CBT without therapist guidance (n=33), CBT-based bibliotherapy without therapist guidance (n=33) and a waiting-list control condition (n=33) for adult participants with severe health anxiety.

Chiropractors have traditionally treated patients with maintenance care, which means that patients are seen on a regular basis to prevent recurrences or to stop a persistent problem getting worse. However, it is not known if this has the expected effect. This study will test the effectiveness of the maintenance care approach. Patients with recurrent or persistent low back pain will be treated in accordance with two different models. The first model is the maintenance care model, meaning that chiropractors will see the patient on a regular basis, regardless symptoms. The other model means that patients should be treated patients only when they themselves experience symptoms bad enough to seek care. After one year, it will be possible to see if there has been any difference between the groups in terms of pain, disability, quality of life and total number of treatments over the study period and to investigate if there is any difference in the cost-effectiveness between the two treatment models.Thus, the study hypothesis is that there is no difference between the two models regarding the number of days with pain. This study will be a multi-centre trial, and as part of the study, it will be necessary to formalize a network of research clinics all over Sweden in which participating chiropractors accept to perform complex data collection.

Background Life is in constant change and affects our habits. In many ways this is positive but it also contributes to less favorable health factors. For example, take the car instead of cycling, take the lift instead of the stairs. This makes us less active in everyday life. Individuals also eat more unhealthy foods in larger portions. In combination with genetics, social in heritage and surrounding factors this contributes to increase overweight and obesity among children not only in adults but also in children. Good treatment methods for childhood obesity are lacking, making prevention very important. The earlier good habits are introduced to a child the better it is. In Early STOPP project we study food, physical activity and sleep habits in the families with a little child.

The aim of this study is to investigate if a meal composition of fat, protein and carbohydrate is important for the hormonal and inflammatory responses Patients with type 1 and type 2 diabetes and healthy controls will be included in the study. At four different occasions the participants will receive lunch with the same amount of calories but different composition of fat, protein, carbohydrate and fiber. Blood samples will be taken before and after the meals. The participants will estimate their satiety. In addition participant will fill in questionnaires about their food habits and wellbeing. This study is the first study to compare both hormonal and inflammatory responses, as well as psychological aspect of the meals, after meals with different composition. Results from this study will help to make recommendation about meal composition which is beneficial for patients with diabetes type 1 and type 2.","Food is an important part of human beings life. During most part of human beings history the shortage of food has been a problem. Today the shortage of food is unknown phenomena in the industrial countries. Instead human being is facing a challenge in obesity epidemic. The number of obese persons has increased since 1980 in all industrial countries. Today only 20 - 25 % of the population in the US has a normal body mass index (BMI). The populations in Europe and Asia are following the same trend. It is known that increased waist (in women > 80 cm and in men > 94 cm) are correlated to insulin resistance, especially in liver because of increased hepatic fat storage. Increased prevalence of obese persons is followed by increased prevalence of patients with impaired glucose tolerance with increased risk for diabetes type 2, cardiovascular disease and cancer. It is known that impaired glucose tolerance and diabetes type 2 can be prevented efficiently with weight loss, reduced total intake of fat and carbohydrate, increased intake of fiber and physical activity. Three popular diets, 1) low fat, 2) low carbohydrate (high-protein and high-fat) and 3) low glycemic load, have recently received much attention. Long term studies of these different diets have shown inconsistent results. There is a discussion today if a better metabolic control is achieved with low-carbohydrate diet compared to low-fat diet in patients with diabetes type 2 compared to the diet recommended by Swedish National Food Administration. In regards of dietary composition, hyperglycemia and dyslipidemia is determined by the amount and quality of ingested carbohydrates and dietary fats. It has been suggested that postprandial hyperglycemia and hypertriglyceridemia triggers oxidative stress and causes inflammation, metabolic alterations associated with endothelial dysfunction. An important aspect of satisfaction after a meal is the feeling of satiety. Subjective feelings of hunger are also obviously related to initiation of food behaviors such as intake of snacks. Neophobia, the fear of new or unfamiliar foods, can also be related to the success or failure of food related behavior change. These feelings of satiety are in turn related to factors such as blood glucose levels. Thus the effect of ingested macronutrients on the postprandial glycemic response is one potential mechanism by which foods may affect satiety. Compared to fats and proteins, dietary carbohydrates may have the greatest effect on postprandial glycemia and insulinemia, and may therefore elicit greater appetitive ratings several hours after consumption compared to lower-glycemic meals. Lately some neuroendocrine hormones (ghrelin, resistin etc) and adipokines (leptin and adiponectin) have received attention as regulators of satiety and plausible causes of obesity. The effect of high-fat, high-protein or low-carbohydrate meals on these hormones are not known. The adverse effects of factors such as chronic stress and depression on general health have been documented for many decades. Apart from having an influence on specific health behaviors, other interacting influences such as general life stress appear to be related directly to alterations in pro-inflammatory and hemostasis processes. The physiological pathways by which psychosocial factors might exert both positive and negative effects on health are numerous and incompletely understood. However, examples of particular interest are findings that suggest that even in relatively healthy persons, chronic negative appraisals of minor life events (hassles) are associated with increased circulating levels of inflammatory factors, whereas persistent positive appraisals of minor life events (uplifts) are associated with decreased levels of such factors. It is thus important to consider general Quality of Life, as well as food-related quality of life together with health and taste attitudes and nutritional knowledge. Finally the gender aspect is also of importance. Previously it has been presumed that the inflammatory and hormonal responses to different diets are the same in men and women. There are known biological and hormonal differences between men and women. One may question why women get heart infarction later in life compared to men and if the risk factors including inflammatory responses, cholesterol levels and other hormonal changes after different diets are the same in men and women. The aim of this study is to compare the high-fat, high-protein and low-carbohydrate meal regarding post prandial glucose and triglycerides concentrations in blood as well as the fast inflammatory response, oxidative stress and appetite regulating hormones in healthy subjects and patients with diabetes. Gender differences will be investigated. In general this study will provide information on which meal compositions that are beneficial for patients with diabetes and healthy subjects. Another aim of this study is to investigate if the psychosocial aspect of the meal such as health locus of control, neophobia, satiety and food related Quality of Life is important for the hormonal responses after the meals. Hypothesis : 1. Meal with high concentration of fiber (15 g) is beneficial for metabolic control in patients with diabetes. 2. Low-carbohydrate meal is beneficial for the metabolic control in patients with diabetes. 3. High-fat meal results in hyperlipidemia which worsens hepatic insulin sensitivity and increases the oxidative stress. 4. High-protein and high-fat meal give earlier satiety and lower blood sugar levels compared to high carbohydrate diet. 5. The perception of the meal affects the metabolic control. Design: 30 patients with type 1 (T1DM) and 30 patients with type 2 diabetes (T2DM)and 30 healthy Controls (HC) will be included in the study. At four different occasions the participants will eat lunch with different composition of fat, protein, carbohydrate and fiber. All groups are divided in subgroups of men and women. Healthy subjects will receive an oral glucose tolerance test before they are included in the study. The composition of the meals is: Low-fat / high-carbohydrate meal (18 Eenergi % (E%) proteins, 28 E% fat and 54% carbohydrates), high-fat meal (18 E% protein, 50 E% fat and 31 E% carbohydrate), high-protein meal (40 E% protein, 30 E% fat and 30 E% carbohydrates) and low-fat / high-carbohydrate and high fiber (18 E% proteins, 28 E% fat and 54% carbohydrates and 15 gram of fibers). Before the study and before the last meal we will measure the waist/hip ratio, BMI and body composition (Bioimpedance). Before the study the participant will document their daily meals during three days. Patients with diabetes should at the same time also document their blood sugar levels (7 times per day, fasting levels, levels before and 2 hours after lunch and dinner and before they go to sleep). Before the other occasions patients will measure their blood sugar levels during one day (7 times). The participants will eat a standardized breakfast at home in the morning before participating in the study. They will eat one of following meals as lunch at 11:30 am: a low-fat and high-carbohydrate diet recommended by Swedish National Food Administration, a high-protein meal, a high-fat meal or a low-fat and high-carbohydrate diet with 15 g of fibers. At each occasions blood samples will be taken 30 minutes and 5 minutes before the lunch and on 30-minute intervals for the following four hours after the lunch. The blood samples will be analysed for hormones regulating blood sugar levels, appetite regulating hormones, marker of oxidative stress and markers of inflammation and endothelia dysfunctions. We have previously shown that insulin sensitivity in liver can be estimated measuring Insulin like Growh factor- I (IGF-I) and Insulin like Growth Factor Binding Protein-1 (IGFBP-1). These hormones will be analyzed in blood samples. The participants will estimate their satiety and their desire to eat in parallel at the time blood samples are withdrawn. At each occasion participants will fill in forms about their general perception of the food and how they estimate their own health. In case a participant do not follow throughout the whole study the results will be analyzed and used in group wise comparisons.",Interventional,N/A,Randomized,,,Crossover Assignment,,Other,None (Open Label),,Diabetes Mellitus,Other,Meals,,High-Carb Meal; High-Fat Meal; High-Fibre Meal; High-Protein Meal,,,,"Inclusion Criteria: - Patient with type 1 DM (age 20-75 years) - Patient with type 2 DM (diabetes duration more than 5 years, age 20- 75 years, BMI 26 - 33 kg/m2). - Healthy volunteers (age 20- 75 years).

NCT02522260,,OptiTrain - Optimal Training for Women With Breast Cancer During Chemotherapy Treatment,28166765,YWengstrom,,9-Jun-15,,,8-Apr-22,Mar-13,,Jun-21,,Completed,OptiTrain - Optimal Training Women With Breast Cancer,"This study on women with breast cancer during and after chemo- and hormonal therapy compares the effect of different physical training programs on physical and mental well-being and systemic inflammation mechanisms in blood. In a sub-group of participants, mitochondrial biogenesis and function and other molecular processes in skeletal muscle biopsies are studied. The women will be randomly allocated into three different intervention arms, a control arm with usual care and two different training arms. All participants will respond to questionnaires and have blood samples and taken and for a subgroup muscle biopsies before and after the exercise intervention. Participants will be supported to uphold exercise through collaboration with Friskis & Svettis and followed for 5 years. Some of the women will also be asked to participate in an in depth interview about the experiences of exercise during ongoing treatment. This study will contribute to increased knowledge about the type, intensity and frequency of training that patients with breast cancer benefit most from with regards to impact on physical and mental wellbeing. This knowledge is of great importance since experience shows that patients and relatives often seek information about rehabilitation, self-care and physical activity. The study will also contribute to the improvement of the patients´ quality of life, ability to return to work, and reduce social costs, but above all, increase the possibility for development and implementation of evidence-based rehabilitation of women with breast cancer during and after active treatment.","Purpose The main aim is to, in women undergoing chemotherapy for breast cancer, explore how different training interventions impact physical capacity and psychological well being. Research questions - Does PA improve the ability to return to work after breast cancer treatment is completed? - How do women with breast cancer during chemotherapy treatment respond to controlled and supervised aerobic fitness training and a combination of aerobic fitness training and strength training in physiological, structural and molecular outcome measures such as muscular strength, aerobic fitness, muscle mass, mitochondrial density, gene activity in muscle and B-Hb, s-CRP and other blood variables,? - Is there a difference between the women in the aerobic exercise training group, the combined aerobic and strength-training group and the control group regarding symptom distress and health related quality of life? - Are there any effects of exercise training on chemotherapy completion and hospitalization rates? - Is adherence to physical exercise impacted by the individuals' personality? - Are there any remaining effects of the physical exercise intervention, on cardiotoxicity, cognitive function, survival and morbidity, up to 5 years after treatment is completed? - Is the intervention cost-effective? Study design and methods Participants A total of 240 women will be recruited from the Department of Oncology Breast and Sarcoma units at Radiumhemmet and Södersjukhuset, Karolinska University Hospital. Inclusion criteria: patients up to 70 years with breast cancer Stage I-IIIa before the start of chemotherapy. Exclusion criteria: patients with advanced disease, patients where physical activity is considered contraindicated because of medical reasons such as heart or lung disease, brain or bone metastases, cognitive dysfunction, and patients who do not speak or understand the Swedish language. Randomization The Clinical Trials Unit (KPE) at Radiumhemmet, Karolinska Universitetssjukhuset, conducts inclusion to the study and randomization. The participants are allocated to either two different training groups or a control group. The participants are also randomized to a muscle biopsy (n=45) before and after the intervention. Group 1) includes strength training of the large muscle groups (2-3 sets, 8-12 repetitions on an intensity of 80 % of 1-RM) and 3x3 min high intensity aerobic exercise (16-18 on Borg scale) on an exercise bike or treadmill twice a week for 16 weeks. Group 2) includes aerobic exercise on an exercise bike or treadmill, 20 min of moderate intensity (13-15 on Borg scale), and 3x3 min high intensity aerobic exercise (16-18 on Borg scale) twice a week during 16 weeks. Group 3) control group, will get standard information around physical activity during treatment but no supervised training. Data Collection Data will be collected for all study participants regarding demographics and diagnosis, cancer treatment, laboratory and sick leave data (patient-reported), relapse, survival, co-morbidity and cause of death in relevant registers. - Data collection of demographic data occurs before (before randomization) and after the intervention, and at three time points: 1 year, 2 years and 5 years after treatment is completed. Baseline is about 5 weeks after surgery and before initiation of chemotherapy. - All participants that accept participation in the study will undergo a resting ECG examination and will provide responses to a small, targeted set of heart disease history questions. - Muscular strength is measured with the instrument JAMAR that is a dynamometer, measuring muscle strength in the hand. Lower limb muscle strength is measured through isometric mid-thigh pull. This is assessed in all study participants at all time points: before and the intervention, year 1, 2, and 5.. The instruments have good reliability and validity. - Before and after the intervention aerobic fitness (VO2-max) of the participants in the intervention groups will be assessed with a submaximal exercise test. This will be measured at all time points: before and the intervention, year 1, 2, and 5. - Algometry, to measure pain sensitivity will be performed at time points: before and after the intervention, year 2 and 5. - Chemotherapy completion, hospitalization, hemoglobin-, lymphocyte- and platelet concentrations during chemotherapy will be extracted from the patients' medical records. - Blood sampling and muscle biopsy procedures will take place at the KPE lab Radiumhemmet, Karolinska University Hospital, Solna. Muscle biopsies will be obtained under local anesthesia in the m. vastus lateralis (approximately 100 mg) with a Bergström needle. This takes place before the intervention starts and 48-72 hours after the last training session. Mitochondrial density and muscle morphology will be analyzed. Venous blood is sampled at time points: before and the intervention, year 1, and 5, for analysis of white cell distribution, for markers of systemic inflammation, and markers of cardiac damage - Physical activity level and energy consumption is determined by ActiGraph GT3X (Actigraph). Actigraph is a combined heart rate sensor and accelerometer that continuously collects data. The method has been previously tested and is shown to have good reliability and validity. In this project all the participants in the three groups will be carrying an Actigraph for seven days, before the intervention. An Activity Diary for daily subjective reporting of physical activity will also be used during the intervention period. Instruments - Piper Fatigue Scale assesses fatigue in four dimensions. The scale has been shown to have psychometric properties that are reliable for assessing subjective dimensions of fatigue among Swedish populations of cancer patients. Data will be collected for all study participants (intervention and control) before randomization and after the intervention, and at 1 year, 2 years and 5 years after treatment. - Memorial Symptom Assessment Scale (MSAS) assesses 32 common cancer-related symptoms. The instrument is validated for Swedish patients with breast cancer. Data will be collected for all study participants before randomization and after the intervention, and at 1 year, 2 years and 5 years after treatment. - EORTC QLQ-C30 is a cancer-specific instrument that measures health-related quality of life in terms of physical, emotional, social, cognitive and everyday function. Data will be collected for all study participants before randomization and after the intervention, and at 1 year, 2 years and 5 years after treatment. - Sense of coherence (SOC) is a questionnaire, which shows how a person sees the world and his own life as comprehensible, manageable and meaningful. Individuals with a strong sense of coherence are able to mobilize the resources to manage their health during illness and treatment. SOC short version consists of l3 questions that all participants complete once before the start of treatment. The Swedish version of the SOC-13 has been shown to have good validity and reliability. It has also demonstrated high internal consistency. - The Amsterdam Cognition Scan- an online neuropsychological test battery that measures a broad variety of cognitive functions, measured five years following inclusion to the exercise intervention - Echocardiogram- to measure cardiac function, five years following inclusion to the exercise intervention Qualitative interviews • Individual interviews about/around the experience of physical activity associated with chemotherapy treatment will be carried out with 15 participants. An open question will be asked, such as ""Can you describe how you experienced the period of training?"". Because of the nature of this question, the women will have the freedom to narrate their stories, and the interview will focus on elements that surface as significant. Supplementary questions will be asked to create depth and further understanding of the phenomena. Data Analysis Muscle and blood analysis: From 45 participants in the project, we plan to take a muscle biopsy before and after the training intervention. The molecular exercise physiology lab is fully equipped to store muscle biopsies and other biological material. Many methods are set-up in our muscle lab and others are performed in different core facilities. Molecular and biochemical analyses: Skeletal muscle biopsy samples are obtained with the percutaneous needle technique. Analysis of protein content, CS activity, and immunohistochemistry will be performed. Quantitative Collected quantitative data will be analysed using parametric statistics for normally distributed data and non-parametric statistics for non-normally distributed data. Subgroup analysis will be conducted with a focus on the type of treatment. Power Calculation: variable cancer related fatigue, selected significance level 0.05, power 0.80 = 240 patients will be recruited in total to detect a statistical difference with medium effect size. Qualitative Qualitative data from individual interviews with 15 patients will be analyzed inductive with content analysis. Workplan Data collection is currently ongoing and 80 patients are included in the study. With the current inclusion rate the 240 participants will be included by the end of 2015. To support the women to uphold PA after treatment is completed a collaboration has been initiated with Friskis & Svettis in Stockholm, during the five year follow up period this will encompass FaR (physical activitiy receipt) and invitations to motivational healthy life style sessions three times a year, the sessions will also include information on longterm effects/symptoms of treatment and support with self care.",Interventional,N/A,Randomized,,,Parallel Assignment,,Supportive Care,None (Open Label),,Well Being,Other; Other; Other,Resistance and aerobic training; Aerobic training; Standard supportive care,,Group 1; Group 2; Group 3,,,,"Inclusion Criteria: patients up to 70 years with breast cancer Stage I-IIIa before the start of chemotherapy.

NCT02450097,,Metabolic and Hormonal Effects of 5:2 Intermittent Fasting in Patients With Type 2 Diabetes and Subjects With Adiposity,,Dnr2013/1618-31/3,,24-Mar-14,,,15-Dec-17,,,Dec-17,,Completed,Metabolic and Hormonal Effects of 5:2 Intermittent Fasting,"The aim of the present study is to investigate in subjects with and without type 2 diabetes the effect of calorie restriction (CR) according to the 5:2 method for 6 months (every week two days caloric fasting with 500 calories for women and 600 calories for men and five days of normal caloric intake) on risk markers for cardiovascular disease and certain cancers (hyperinsulinemia, insulin resistance, IGF-1, IGFBP-1, IGFBP-2, glucose, HbA1c, blood lipids, markers of inflammation and oxidative stress) and on peptides regulating glucose metabolism and appetite as well as the effect on blood pressure, body composition, waist- and hip- circumference. DNA will also be analysed at the start and after 6 months to investigate any epigenetic effects. After completed study there will be a follow up after additional 6 months.","Background: It is well known that the majority of the population in the western world eats too much calories in relation to physical activity. This results in increased body weight, insulin resistance and premature age-related diseases such as diabetes, hypertension, cardiovascular disease, even dementia and certain types of cancer like colon cancer and breast cancer. Several studies have shown that calorie restriction (CR) reduces the risk for cardiovascular disease, diabetes and Alzheimer's disease. Animal studies have shown that CR reduces insulin like growth factor-1 (IGF-1) levels, cancer incidence and prolong lifespan. Chronic every day CR decreases blood lipids and glucose, blood pressure, insulin resistance and inflammatory markers. It has been shown to reduce incidence of atherosclerosis directly correlated to the CR and not to weight reduction. However, only few studies have investigated the effect of periodic CR in healthy subjects with adiposity and in patients with type 2 diabetes. Moreover, no studies to our knowledge have studied if there is any gender differences in the metabolic response to periodic CR or if the response is dependent on the degree of adiposity and metabolic disturbance. Since it for many people is very difficult to every day reduce caloric intake , the new method to reduce it to 25% of the normal intake during two days a week is of a great interest to study regarding the metabolic and hormonal effects in men and women. Questions to be answered; Do women and men respond differently to this diet and do subjects with type 2 diabetes respond differently to those without diabetes. How many subjects can continue to follow this new diet during the 6 months study and during further 6 months follow up? Primary end points: Change from baseline in fasting serum insulin, C-peptide and insulin like factor binding protein-1 (IGFBP-1) in 6 months. Secondary end points: Changes in body composition including body fat percentage, blood pressure, blood lipids, blood glucose, markers of inflammation, oxidative stress and hormones regulating appetite, and changes in wellbeing, diet habits and physical activity. Material/Subjects: 100 subjects will be recruited via media and from outpatient clinics for diabetes care at Karolinska University Hospital and Sophiahemmet Hospital in Stockholm, Sweden. Method: The subjects who have given informed consent will get a questionnaire regarding well-being, physical activity, life style, family history of diabetes, obesity, hypertension, cardiovascular disease, cancer and of dementia, previous medical and weight history and drugs used. The subjects will be examined by a doctor at a screening visit and blood and urine samples will be taken. Waist and hip circumference, blood pressure and pulse at sitting position after 10 minutes rest, estimation of the body composition, percent body fat and free fat mass (muscle mass) will be registered. The subjects will also respond to a questionnaire regarding diet habits and a meal diary during three ordinary days. A group of 10 to 15 subjects will be informed at a meeting with the doctors, nurses and dietitian about the diet (given 25 examples) during the 2 days of calorie restriction and recommended diet (Mediterranean or Nordic diet) during the other 5 days in the week. The subjects will respond to questions regarding hunger, fullness and satiety during the 2 days of calorie restriction (500 for women and 600 for men) and register which of 25 possible given meals they select during the calorie restriction days every week for 26 weeks. After 6 weeks there will be a follow up with new blood and urine tests, wellbeing questionnaires and after 3 and 6 months new blood and urine test, physical examination, questionnaires regarding physical activity, wellbeing, and diet habits and meal diary during 3 days. After completed study there will be a follow up after additional 6 months when participant are free to choose too continue with CR or not. At all visits blood pressure, pulse; waist and hip circumference and body composition will be registered. The blood and urine samples will be taken in the morning after an overnight fast and after a day of normal diet. The blood and urine samples will be stored in a local human sample bank at the hospital for later analysis after the study is closed.",Interventional,N/A,N/A,,,Single Group Assignment,,Other,None (Open Label),,Obesity; Diabetes Type 2,Other,Caloric restriction,,Lifestyle counseling,,,,Inclusion criteria: - Age > 18 years of age. - Subjects without diabetes with BMI 23-37. - Patients with Type 2 diabetes and diabetes duration between 0.5-12 years and BMI 25-37 Exclusion criteria: - BMI below 23 - Waist circumference 80 cm or less for women and 94 cm or less than for men. - Total fat percent of body weight less than 23%. - Treatment with insulin and sulfonylurea drugs. - Chronic kidneys disease (CKD) stage 4 and 5 (eGFR <30 ml/min). - Pregnancy and breast-feed. - Active athletes. - History of eating disorder. - Participation in another ongoing study. - If participant is not eligible to complete the study.,All,18 Years,N/A,Accepts Healthy Volunteers,,100,,Change from baseline in fasting serum insulin in 6 months.,6 months,"Serum insulin will be measured using a radioimmunoassay (RIA; Pharmacia insulin RIA 100, Pharmacia Diagnostics, Uppsala, Sweden).",,,,,,,Lifestyle counseling,Other,Intermittent Caloric restriction in 3 Groups: I- 40 patients with diabetes type 2 BMI 25.1-37 II- 40 non diabetic over weight subjects with BMI 25.1-37 III- 20 non diabetic subject with BMI 23.1 - 25 and visceral fat,,Karolinska University Hospital,Stockholm,Sweden,,,,,,,,Principal Investigator; Karolinska University Hospital; Kerstin Brismar; M.D/Professor,Karolinska University Hospital,Other,,,"Kerstin Brismar, Professor",Principal Investigator,Karolinska University Hospital,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Mon Apr 11 14:56:59 2022

Furthermore Mirena offers numerous noncontraceptive benefits and addresses different medical needs for women in reproductive and non reproductive age. Side effects such as menstrual abnormalities are important reasons for early discontinuation of a contraceptive method. Irregular bleeding pattern and spotting represents a well known adverse effect during the first months of use with Mirena and corresponds to the most important factor that negatively influences the acceptability of the IUS. Up to today no standard treatment has been suggested to resolve this issue. By inducing amenorrhea within a short period of treatment with an anti-progesterone, mifepristone, prior to insertion of Mirena, the bleeding irregularities during the first months of use might be reduced and could therefore represent an important strategy for increasing acceptability of this contraceptive system.

NCT01726751,,Spinal Cord Stimulation in the Irritable Bowel Syndrome - a Randomized Cross-over Trial,25786486,SCS-IBS-004,,30-Oct-12,,,7-Nov-18,,,Apr-14,,Completed,Spinal Cord Stimulation for Pain Relief in Irritable Bowel Syndrome,"To elucidate Spinal Cord Stimulation (SCS) as treatment for IBS. An SCS system with a 4-polar electrode at the T5-8 level is implanted. In a randomized, cross-over study design, active stimulation is compared to a period without stimulation, with an ensuing tailing stimulation period, twice as long. Patients recorded average pain level, pain attacks, number of diarrheas and global quality of life. At the end of the study patients can choose to retain their SCS stimulation system or have it removed. The outcome of the present trial will show whether SCS is a useful treatment of IBS. The long-term follow-up will show the continuous amelioration of SCS over at least six months.","The primary aim of the study is to investigate if the typical chronic abdominal pain in IBS can be ameliorated by SCS. Secondary aims are possible effects of SCS on diarrhea or constipation, quality of life and side effects, and further to evaluate the feasibility and tolerability of SCS as validated by the willingness of the patients to retain the SCS stimulation equipment. Eligible patients are selected by a gastroenterologist for the study inclusion criteria: age 18-60, fulfilment of Rome II criteria, abdominal pain episodically reaching > 4 on a 0-10 VAS, and stable symptoms for the past 2 years. A thorough clinical work-up is done to exclude organic disease, including routine blood and electrolyte status, hepatic enzyme function and lactose tolerance test as well as colonoscopy or colon x-ray. Patients with significant somatic or psychiatric co-morbidity will be excluded. Study design: A quadripolar SCS-lead (Quad-plus®, Medtronic Inc., Minnesota, USA) was implanted via a percutaneous puncture at the Th11/12 level of the dorsal epidural space in local anesthesia with the patient in the prone position. The electrode is advanced to the mid-thoracic level, aiming for a final position around T6-T8, until intraoperative stimulation yields paresthesias covering the abdomen . The electrode is then connected to an impulse generator (Itrel-3®, Medtronic Inc.) implanted subcutaneously in the upper left quadrant of the abdomen. Stimulation frequency will be set to 50 Hz for all patients but other parameters (electrode pole combinations, amplitudes and pulse width) are adjusted and set to produce adequate paresthesias of comfortable intensity. During the subsequent ongoing trial reprogramming was allowed, if necessary for optimal stimulation. SCS will be started 2 weeks after surgery. Thereafter patients are randomized to either of two study arms: one starting with SCS for a period of six weeks (A), and another with six weeks without SCS (delayed start) (B). When on active SCS, patients are prompted to stimulate 8-12 h per day. Patients are instructed to increase the stimulation upon pain attack break-through. After six weeks, patients without stimulation were crossed-over to stimulation and vice versa. After another six weeks both study arms included continued stimulation for additional 12 weeks up to 26 weeks. After a final 2-week period without stimulation the trial is terminated. During the whole study period patients will record, on a daily basis: 1) number of pain attacks, 2) number of diarrhea episodes, 3) average pain level for the day (0-10) and 4) average quality of life (0-10). Patients are scheduled for regular controls, at 2, 8, 14, 26 and 28 weeks after implantation. Patient compliance will be ensured, as the impulse generator stores information on the percentage of elapsed time that stimulation has been in use. At termination of the study participants were offered to keep the implanted SCS system or have it removed. All patients will be contacted for a structured telephone interview follow-up at a time-point varying between 18 to 78 months after the study termination. A questionnaire was used to assess present pain level, medication, use of the SCS system, side effects and global satisfaction. Patients will also be asked whether they would have participated if they had known the outcome in advance, and if they would recommend a trial of SCS treatment to someone else with similar gastrointestinal problems. All patients will be evaluated with the hospital anxiety and depression scale (HADS) and a modified version of the gastrointestinal symptom rating scale for IBS (GSRS-IBS).",Interventional,Phase 1/Phase 2,Randomized,,,Crossover Assignment,Spinal cord stimulation,Treatment,Single (Participant),,Irritable Bowel Syndrome; Constipation; Diarrhea; Pain,Device; Device,Spinal Cord Stimultion (SCS); Spinal cord nerve stimulation,,Early off-stimulation (group B); Early on-stimulation (group A); Early off-stimulation (group B); Early on-stimulation (group A),"Quad-plus®, Medtronic Inc., MN, USA",,,"Inclusion Criteria: - age 18-60, Rome II criteria, abdominal pain >4 (0-10 VAS), stable symptoms for >2 years Exclusion Criteria: - other gastrointestinal disease, somatic or psychiatric co-morbidity",All,18 Years,60 Years,No,,10,,To investigate if typical abdominal pain of IBS can be ameliorated by SCS?,According to protocol for 26 weeks,"During the whole study period each patient will record the number of pain attacks.

NCT01604369,,Cryoablation as Standard Treatment of Atrial Flutter - Long Term Efficacy and Patient Content,32208915,KS1,,21-May-12,,,,,,Jun-16,,Completed,Cryoablation as Standard Treatment of Atrial Flutter,"The hypothesis of the present study is to evaluate cryoablation(cooling of the tissue) as standard therapy of common atrial flutter,focusing on efficacy, feasibility, procedure time, and patient content. The purpose of this study is to determine whether cryoablation, performed only by operators experienced in cryothermic ablation is effective and safe in the treatment of atrial flutter.","Atrial flutter (AFL), a common atrial tachyarrhythmia may cause significant symptoms and serious adverse effects including embolic stroke, myocardial ischemia and congestive heart failure. Currently, radiofrequency (RF) catheter ablation of the cavotricuspid isthmus (CTI) is considered first-line therapy for treatment of CTI-dependent AFL. However, RF ablation of the CTI is associated with significant pain during lesion delivery. Furthermore, RF ablation can potentially injure cardiac structures adjacent to the CTI such as the AV node, tricuspid valve and right coronary artery. RF ablation can also lead to steam pops, cardiac tamponade and fatal complications have also been reported in association with CTI-ablation. Ablation using cryothermal energy (Cryo) has several potential advantages over RF ablation including greater catheter stability due to adherence to myocardial tissue during applications, reduced risk of thrombus formation, systemic embolization, and lower risk of myocardial perforation due to preservation of tissue architecture. The investigators have in a prospective randomized, single centre study (CRAFT) investigated efficacy and safety of RF versus Cryo for atrial flutter, and showed that cryoablation is as effective as RF ablation in the short and long term. The patients perceived significantly less pain and required significantly lower doses of analgesia and sedation during cryoablation compared to RF ablation. The study was powered for non-inferiority with 75 patients in each group. The objective of the present study is to expand the findings from the CRAFT study in a larger cohort of patients, letting only operators experienced in cryothermic CTI ablation use Cryo as standard therapy focusing on efficacy, feasibility, procedure time, and patient content. To perform an ablation within the study, the electrophysiologist must have a previous experience of a minimum of 25 cryoablations of atrial flutter.",Interventional,N/A,N/A,,,Single Group Assignment,,Treatment,None (Open Label),,Atrial Flutter,Procedure,Medtronic Freezor Max Cardiac Cryoablation Catheter,,Cryoablation,Cryoablation; CTI ablation,,,"Inclusion Criteria: - Consecutive patients referred to our institution for ablation therapy of ECG-documented, typical CTI dependent AFL. - Patients above the age of 18 having symptomatic CTI-dependent AFL documented on a 12-lead ECG with typical ECG appearance of negative saw tooth waves in the inferior limb leads and positive deflections in V1 or positive saw tooth waves in the inferior limb leads and negative deflections in V1. - Patients with a history of atrial fibrillation will only be included if they have predominant atrial flutter under chronic treatment with class I or III antiarrhythmic agents.

NCT01547260,,Phase I/II Study of Lenalidomide and Gemcitabine as First-line Treatment in Patients With Locally Advanced or Metastatic Pancreatic Cancer,,LENAGEM-PANC,,28-Feb-12,,,,,,Nov-14,,Completed,Lenalidomide and Gemcitabine as First-line Treatment in Patients With Pancreatic Cancer,The purpose of this study is to ascertain whether treatment with lenalidomide or lenalidomide in combination with gemcitabine induces modulation of immune effector functions and to characterize the nature of immune functions.,"Pancreatic cancer is characterised by aggressive growth, treatment resistance and an extremely poor prognosis. In subjects with locally advanced or metastatic disease, the median survival is approximately 6 - 11 months and 2 - 6 months, respectively. The currently accepted treatment for this disease in EU is gemcitabine which supplanted treatment with 5-FU after it was shown that median survival duration was marginally improved (4.41 and 5.65 months respectively, p = 0,022). The reported median survival time for subjects treated with single-agent gemcitabine in randomized phase III studies ranged form 4.9 to 7.2 months. Despite these improvements in the treatment of pancreatic cancer, the prognosis remains very poor. Lenalidomide (Revlimid®) belongs to a proprietary class of compounds called immunomodulatory drugs (IMiDs). IMiDshave both immunomodulatory and anti-angiogenic properties which could confer antitumour and antimetastatic effects. Lenalidomide has been demonstrated to possess anti-angiogenic activity through inhibition of bFGF, VEGF and TNF-alpha induced endothelial cell migration, due at least in part to inhibition of Akt phosphorylation response to bFGF.In addition, lenalidomide has a variety of immunomodulatory effects. Gemcitabine (Gemzar®) is a synthetic pyrimidine nucleoside analogue that is used as standard treatment of advanced pancreatic cancer. Beside the cytotoxic activity of gemcitabine, accumulating evidence has indicated that the product promote specific anticancer immune responses that contribute to the therapeutic effects of conventional therapy.Down-regulation in survival rate of pancreatic cell lines has more recently been observed, when treated with lenalidomide and gemcitabine in sub-optimal concentrations.Those data supports a hypothesis of a potential hyper-additive affect of the treatments given in combination. Therefore lenalidomide and gemcitabine should be of major interest to explore for combination therapy. This is a phase I/II open-label, multi-center study. It will consist of a phase I dose-finding part and a phase II part during which subjects will be treated at the MTD established during phase I. Lenalidomide will be administered by a stepwise dose-escalation schedule in the phase I part. Thus, the primary endpoint in the phase I part is to determine the MTD and safety of the regimen lenalidomide and gemcitabine as first-line treatment in subjects with advanced pancreatic cancer.In the phase II part, primary endpoint is to evaluate the immunomodulatory effects of lenalidomide in combination with gemcitabine in the same patient population.",Interventional,Phase 1/Phase 2,Randomized,,,Parallel Assignment,,Treatment,None (Open Label),,Pancreatic Carcinoma.,Drug; Drug,Gemzar; Revlimid,,Lenalidomide; gemcitabine,Revlimid; Gemzar,,,"Inclusion Criteria: - Histologically or cytologically confirmed, unresectable, locally advanced, or metastatic adenocarcinoma of the pancreas. - ECOG performance status of 0 or 1, see Appendix 1. - Life expectancy > 12 weeks. - Must understand and voluntarily sign an informed consent form. - Age > 18 years at the time of signing informed consent form. - Must be able to adhere to the study visit schedule and other protocol requirements. - Female subjects of childbearing potential† must: - Understand that the study medication is expected to have a teratogenic risk - Agree to use, and be able to comply with, effective contraception without interruption, 4 weeks before starting study drug, throughout study drug therapy (including dose interruptions) and for 4 weeks after the end of study drug therapy, even if she has amenorrhoea - Male subjects must: - Agree to use condoms throughout study drug therapy, during any dose interruption and for one week after cessation of study therapy if their partner is of childbearing potential and has no contraception. - Agree not to donate semen during study drug therapy and for one week after end of study drug therapy Exclusion Criteria: - Prior use of systemic chemotherapy for the treatment of adenocarcinoma of the pancreas (with the exception of gemcitabine, fluorouracil, or capecitabine in the adjuvant setting). - Laboratory abnormalities: - Prior history of malignancy within 5 years (except basal or squamous cell carcinoma or carcinoma in situ of the cervix or breast, localized prostate cancer with PSA < 1,0 mg/dL). - Subjects with a history of or active DVT or PE that are not therapeutically managed on a stable dose of appropriate anticoagulant. - Brain metastases (subjects that are asymptomatic and do not require steroid control may be enrolled at the discretion of the investigator). - Surgery within 28 days prior to cycle 1 Day 1 (minimally invasive procedures for the purpose of diagnosis or staging of the disease are permitted, including stent placement and insertion of central venous access advice). - Any condition, including the presence of laboratory abnormalities, which places the subject at unacceptable risk if he/she were to participate in the study or confounds the ability to interpret data from the study. - Any serious medical condition or psychiatric illness that places the subject at an unacceptable risk for study participation or would prevent the subject from signing the informed consent form. - Prior therapy with lenalidomide or thalidomide. - Use of any other experimental drug or therapy within 28 days prior to Cycle 1 Day 1. - Pregnant or lactating females.",All,19 Years,N/A,No,,34,,Safety (phase I).; Immunomodulatory effect (phase II).,Within the first day after start of treatment until 30 days post the last dose of study drug.; Within the first day of treatment until 60 days after start of treatment.,"In the phase I part of the study, the primary outcome is to determine the MTD and safety of the regimen lenalidomide and gemcitabine in combination.

Apart from the glycemic actions, cardiovascular effects by GLP-1 have recently been reviewed. Receptors for GLP-1 are expressed in the rodent and human heart and acute activation of GLP-1 signalling has been shown to influence e.g. heart rate and blood pressure. In a knock-out mouse model, GLP-1R-/- mice exhibited a defective cardiovascular contractile response together with left ventricular hypertrophy. GLP-1 improves severe left ventricular heart failure in humans suffering from a myocardial infarction. Hence, it has been demonstrated that GLP-1 exerts direct functional effects through both GLP-1 receptor dependent and independent pathways in the heart. Native GLP-1 is an extremely short acting peptide, with a half-time breakdown of 1-2 minutes, a feature that makes it unsuitable as a drug treatment for type 2 diabetes. To this end, several long-acting GLP-1 analogues, drugs for treating type 2 diabetes, have been tested for this purpose. The analogue liraglutide exerts its effects via the native GLP-1 receptor, localized not only on the pancreatic β-cells, but also in the human heart. Interestingly, liraglutide has been demonstrated to have beneficial effect on heart function in mice. Taken together, recent data shows that GLP-1 and its stable analogue liraglutide exert beneficial cardiovascular effects. The purpose of this study is to determine whether the glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) analogue liraglutide improves heart function (measured as left ventricle longitudinal function and/or functional reserve during rest and/or after exercise) after 18 weeks of liraglutide + metformin, compared with glimepiride + metformin, using tissue Doppler echocardiography.","The subjects will attend a screening visit (Visit 1) in order to assess their eligibility. If found eligible, the subjects will return at Visit 2 within approximately 4 weeks, after Visit 1, with an up-titration with metformin 1 g BID or the maximal tolerated dosage of metformin (Run-in period). At Visit 2 patients will be tested for; - Heart function at rest and during an exercise ECG Stress Test with tissue Doppler echocardiography - 24-hour blood pressure - Anthropometric assessment - Symptoms of dyspnea or fatigue (scoring system, classified as NYHA). - Quality of life (SF 36) - Blood test (venipuncture) Subsequently thereafter, subjects will during visit 2 be randomized to receive either liraglutide 1.8 mg s.c. (initial dose of 0.6 mg with an up-titration of 0.6 mg every week, final dose 1.8 mg QD) or glimepiride 4 mg p.o (initial dose of 2 mg, with an up-titration of 1 mg every week, final dose 4 mg QD). At Visit 2, subjects will be supplied with a glucose meter (Abbot Contour) and instruction on use of the device including regular calibration according to the manufacturer's instruction. Subjects will be instructed on how to record the results of the self measured plasma glucose (SMPG) values in the meter. Subjects will then ask to monitor a 7 point profile glucose curve consecutively in three days before visit 3, at visit 4 and at the end of treatment (visit 5).

An E/E' ratio (ratio of early diastolic velocities of mitral inflow derived Doppler imaging and myocardial movement derived by tissue Doppler imaging) >15 is considered diagnostic of diastolic dysfunction and an E/E' ratio < 8 as diagnostic of the absence of diastolic heart failure.

NCT02746757,,The Role of Glucagon Like Peptide-1 in the Protective Effect of Remote Ischemic Conditioning During Ischemia-reperfusion,27702763,RIPC GLP-1,,18-Apr-16,,,7-Mar-18,May-15,,Jan-18,,Completed,Glucagon Like Peptide-1 in Remote Ischemic Conditioning,The study was designed to investigate whether glucagon like peptide-1 is a mediator of protection of endothelial function induced by remote ischemic conditioning in ischemia-reperfusion,"The mechanism behind the cardioprotective effect of remote preconditioning is incompletely understood. Data from experimental studies suggest that a combination of humoral and neurogenic factors mediate the transition of protective signals from peripheral tissues to the myocardium. A major break-through in the understanding of the signaling was the observation that vagal nerve activation is involved. Key signaling pathways in the target organ are likely to be mediated via the vascular endothelium which is known to play an important role during the early reperfusion period. Thus, animal studies have demonstrated that RIPC stimulates endothelial nitric oxide production secondary to down-regulation of arginase. It remains unclear, however, whether RIPC via activation of endothelial nitric oxide preserves endothelial function in humans. Additional data indicate strongly that glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) provides protection against ischemia-reperfusion injury in experimental animals models as well as in clinical studies. The role of GLP-1 in the protective effect of RIPC has previously not been investigated, however. The present study was therefore designed to determine the involvement of GLP-1 in the protection induced by RIPC via endothelial activation in humans. To this end we use a model of reversible ischemia-reperfusion injury in the forearm, and the GLP-1 antagonist exendin 9-39 (Ex 9-39). Objective To test the hypothesis that GLP-1 is a mediator of protection of endothelial function induced by RIPC in ischemia-reperfusion. Endpoints Primary: Change in endothelium dependent vasodilatation induced by RIPC Secondary: Change in plasma GLP-1 Study subjects The study is performed on healthy volunteers 18-60 years of age. All subjects will undergo a screening including medical history and routine clinical examination, and should be free of medication. A screening blood sample includes hemoglobin, leukocyte and platelet count, fasting blood glucose, HbA1c, total cholesterol, LDL cholesterol, HDL cholesterol, triglycerides. Methods Endothelial function is determined in the brachial artery by flow-mediated dilation (FMD). Briefly, non-invasive examination of the radial artery of the non-dominant arm is performed with a 11 MHz (output 12 MHz) linear-array transducer connected to a Vivid E9. The transducer is connected to a flexible tripod to prevent movement of the probe. Images are recorded and saved every third second at end-diastole. Baseline radial artery diameter is recorded for one minute and defined as a mean from 20 images. A blood pressure cuff is placed around the upper part of the forearm, which is inflated to 30 mmHg above systolic pressure or 200 mmHg for 5 min. The diameter of the radial artery is continuously recorded for 3 min during hyperemia following deflation of the cuff. The three frames displaying maximum dilatation at end-diastole (triggered from the ECG) are used to calculate a mean diameter. All images are analyzed with Brachial analyzer (Medical Imaging Applications, Iowa City, IA, USA). FMD is calculated as a percentage increase in diameter from baseline diameter according to the following formula: diameter following cuff deflation-baseline diameter/baseline diameter x 100. All evaluations are performed blinded. A decrease in endothelial function is an established outcome of reperfusion injury. Study protocol After determining the basal FMD ischemia is induced by inflating a cuff to 200 mmHg on the upper arm for 20 min followed by reperfusion. FMD is determined again 20 min after the start of reperfusion . Each individual is examined on three occasions: A) ischemia-reperfusion without intervention, B) ischemia-reperfusion with intervention by RIPC, C) ischemia-reperfusion with RIPC and administration of Ex 9-39. The order of the examination is randomly assigned by drawing one of three numbers. RIPC is performed in cycles of 5 min of inflation (200 mmHg or 20 mmHg above systolic blood pressure) and 5 min deflation of an automatic blood pressure cuff around the left thigh. Two cycles are performed during ischemia and 2 cycles immediately after reperfusion. The GLP-1 receptor antagonist Ex 9-39 is administered as a bolus of 7500 pmol/kg followed by an iv infusion starting 15 min before the initial FMD and maintained until the second FMD at a rate of 500 pmol/kg/min. The dose is based on previous experiences from studies on humans. During the experimental protocols the following blood samples are collected for analysis of glucose, insulin, GLP-1.",Interventional,N/A,Randomized,,,Crossover Assignment,,Other,None (Open Label),,Healthy Volunteers,Other; Drug,Remote conditioning; Exendin 9-39,,Ischemia-reperfusion with RIPC; Ischemia-reperfusion with RIPC and Ex 9-39; Ischemia-reperfusion with RIPC and Ex 9-39,,,,Inclusion Criteria: Healthy male volunteers - Exclusion Criteria: -,Male,18 Years,60 Years,Accepts Healthy Volunteers,,12,,Change in endothelium dependent vasodilatation,20 min post-reperfusion,,,,,,,,Ischemia-reperfusion no intervention; Ischemia-reperfusion with RIPC; Ischemia-reperfusion with RIPC and Ex 9-39,No Intervention; Experimental; Experimental,Ischemia-reperfusion without intervention; Ischemia-reperfusion with intervention by RIPC; Ischemia-reperfusion with RIPC and Ex 9-39,,"Karolinska Institutet, Karolinska University Hospital",Stockholm,Sweden,,,,,,,,Principal Investigator; Karolinska Institutet; John Pernow; Professor,Karolinska Institutet,Other,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Mon Apr 11 14:57:01 2022

It is one of the most common skin diseases and is associated with reduced quality of life, functional impairment and sleep difficulties. There are currently no pharmacological treatments that are effective in curing the disorder in the longer-term. Itching is one of the core symptoms in AD and it has been shown that the behavioral response to itching, scratching, has a maintaining function in AD. Reducing scratching may therefore play an important role in alleviating AD. Although behavioral aspects play a significant role in AD only a few studies have investigated the effect of psychological treatment for AD. These studies have shown promising results and the present study aim to add to the body of knowledge by testing a new form of cognitive behavioral treatment for AD. This new treatment is based on the idea that patients could benefit from training in exposure to events that could lead to increase in itching while refraining from scratching.

The safety of cholecystectomy performed during an episode of pancreatitis has been questioned. The aim of the present randomized controlled trial is to compare the outcome in terms of recurrent pancreatitis and gallstone-related events between index cholecystectomy, performed during the first admission for acute pancreatitis, and scheduled cholecystectomy, performed 4-6 weeks after discharge.","Background: There is still considerable debate regarding the optimal timing of cholecystectomy in mild biliary pancreatitis. It is widely accepted to wait until the patient's clinical condition allows performing cholecystectomy in severe biliary pancreatitis with systemic or local complications. On the other hand, the recommendations are not very clear when it comes to patients with mild biliary pancreatitis. The British Society of Gastroenterology and American Gastroenterological Association guidelines recommendation is to perform cholecystectomy within 2-to 4- week interval after the initial episode. However, the safety of cholecystectomy performed during an episode of pancreatitis is also controversial. In a systematic review the overall readmission rate was 18% after index cholecystectomy, 8% for recurrent biliary pancreatitis, 3 % for acute cholecystitis and 7 % for biliary colic. Methods The study is performed as a Randomised controlled trials with two parallel arms and a ratio of 1:1. Patients admitted with acute pancreatitis are checked for eligibility criteria for the study. Mild pancreatitis is defined as pancreatitis without local complications such as necrosis or organ failure. Patients who are eligible obtained oral and written information about the study and invited to be included. Patients who accept participation sign a consent form and are included. The included patients are randomized into index cholecystectomy (IC) or scheduled cholecystectomy (SC). Randomization is done with a sealed envelope system. The allocation sequence is created by an online random generator. There is no blocking. After randomization, the patient as well as the responsible are immediately informed about the allocation. The IC and SC are protocolled to be performed within 24-48 hours from randomization, and after 6 weeks from discharge respectively. Daily blood samples, pain and well-being scores are obtained during index admission until discharge, at 1-month follow-up for SC group and at the scheduled cholecystectomy.

NCT02619149,,Piperacllin Versus Placebo in Patients Undergoing Surgery for Acute Cholecystitis,32860109,AVAC,,26-Nov-15,,,6-Mar-18,,,Jan-18,,Completed,Piperacllin Versus Placebo in Patients Undergoing Surgery for Acute Cholecystitis,"The benefit from antibiotic prophylaxis in patients undergoing laparoscopic cholecystectomy for acute cholecystitis is insufficiently known. The aim of the present double-blind randomized controlled is to compare piperacilin with placebo in patients undergoing cholecystectomy for acute cholecystitis with anamnesis not exceeding 5 days. Altogether 100 patients are intended to be included. Primary endpoint is biliary contamination. Secondary endpoints are postoperative hospital stay, health-related quality of life, pain perception, postoperative markers of inflammatory response, surgical site infections, infectious complications other than surgical site infections, health economy and relationship between symptom anamnesis and bile contamination.","Background Inflammation in the gallbladder due to obstruction of gallstones (acute cholecystitis) is a common condition and one of the most common indications for laparoscopic cholecystectomy. In most cases, the procedure may be performed without great risk of severe complications. In some cases, however, the congested bile in the gallbladder may become infected. In clinical routine, acute cholecystitis is often managed as an infectious condition, despite the fact that previous studies have shown that the bile in most cases of acute cholecystitis is sterile. On the other hand, antibiotic prophylaxis may reduce the risk of surgical site infections in those cases when there is a manifest bacterial contamination and, perhaps, also reduce the risk of contamination. There is firm evidence supporting acute surgery, prefereably laparoscopic cholecystectomy, but the benefit from antibiotic treatment has not been full evaluated. Previous studies have shown that the benefit from antibiotic prophylaxis is very limited in case of laparoscopic cholecystectomy for uncomplicated gallstone disease. There are, however, very few studies that have assessed antibiotic prophylaxis in surgery for acute cholecystitis. The aim of the present study is to assess the benefit of antibiotic prophylaxis in patients undergoing laparoscopic cholecystectomy for acute cholecystitis. Methods The study is based on patients admitted for acute cholecystitis at the department of acute surgery, Karolinska University Hospital Huddinge. In case the patients fulfill the inclusion critera and are suitable for laparoscopic surgery, written and oral information about the study is given. In case they agree to participate in the study, treatment allocation is determined by a sealed envelope system. The patients are randomised to receive either Piperacillin 4g x 3 iv preoperatively as prophylaxis or placebo (saline infusion). The study is double-blind. Piperacillin/placebo is administrated by a research nurse after allocation. The infusion is covered by a bag in order to maintain blinding. Neither the surgeon performing the procedure, nor the patient or staff caring for the patient are informed about the allocation. The procedure should be performed within 24 days after inclusion. Administration of Piperacillin/placebo is started immediately after inclusion and continued until the procedure is completed. If a categorical indication for antibiotic treatment occurs during surgery, the allocated infusion is removed and the patient is given antibiotic as decided by the surgeon. In such cases, the patient stays in the study and is analysed according to an intention to treat. During the laparoscopic cholecystectomy, at least 10 cc of bile is aspirated under sterile conditions from the fundus of the gallbladder with a long needle before the start of the peritoneum dissection. The bile is sent for aerobic and anaerobic culture. Bacteria are identified using standard laboratory procedures. Sample size estimation If the incidence of positive cultures is 50% and in the placebo group and this is reduced to 25% if antibiotic prophylaxis is given, 36 patients in each arm would be required in order to reach 80% chance of detecting this difference at a p<0.05 level of significance (one sided test). A total sample of 100 patients should thus be sufficient to test the primary outcome measure. Follow-up Samples for CRP, interleukins, bilirubin, AST, ALT and ALP are taken daily from the peroperative day until postoperative day 2. Quality of life is assessed by SF-36 preoperatively. Level of pain is estimated based on the MacGill Pain Questionnaire from the day of the procedure until postoperative day 2. One month postoperatively, the patient is invited to follow-up.

NCT01854333,,The Swedish Versions of ADOS and ADI-R: Psychometric Validation,,EvaluationADOS&ADI-R,,8-May-13,,,,,,Nov-14,,Completed,The Swedish Versions of ADOS and ADI-R: Psychometric Validation,"Autism spectrum disorders (ASD) are early onset chronic conditions coined by deficits in social reciprocity, communication and stereotypic interests and activities. Other functional impairments such as mental retardation, ADHD, known genetic syndromes and epilepsy are frequent coexisting problems. ASD cause considerable suffering for the affected individuals and burden for their families. With an estimated prevalence exceeding 1%, recent population-based studies suggest that ASD are no rare phenomena. Lifetime societal costs for services and support, together with the opportunity costs of lost productivity in a prototypic developed country are estimated SEK 15.6 million for someone with and SEK 10.3 million for a person without co-existing mental retardation. Despite ongoing efforts, no diagnostically informative biomarker has yet been identified for ASD. The development, refinement and evaluation of behavioral assessment tools has therefore been decisive to progress and quality assurance in ASD clinical practice and research. The most widely used and thoroughly evaluated instruments for ASD in international child mental health are the Autism Diagnostic Interview- Revised (ADI-R) and the Autism Diagnostic Observation Schedule (ADOS). The ADI-R and ADOS are deemed highly by the ASD expert community and thus commonly labeled as being the ""gold standard"" in ASD diagnostics. Although, Swedish translations of the ADI-R and ADOS exist, a Swedish standardization and cross-cultural validation is still lacking, impeding good clinical practice and research prerequisites for ASD in Sweden. The applied project seeks to broadly establish reliability and validity of the Swedish translations of the ADI-R and ADOS in order to enhance evidence-based clinical practice and stimulate internationally competitive ASD research in Sweden.","Objectives: The present study seeks to determine for the first time the reliability and validity of the Swedish versions of the Autism Diagnostic Interview-Revised (ADI-R)and Autism Diagnostic Observation Schedule (ADOS). The combination of these two assessments is deemed the ""gold standard"" of diagnosing ASD in international practice and research. ADI-R and ADOS are widely used (translated into 15 languages) and have been rigorously and convincingly evaluated in other countries. The Swedish translations of the ADI-R (interview schedule, algorithms) and ADOS (observation schedules, algorithms) have not yet been tested for scientific properties and feasibility, hampering best clinical practice, evidence-based diagnostics and research premises for ASD in Sweden. Therefore, this study aims at standardizing the Swedish forms of the ADI-R and ADOS to and ensure their cross-cultural validity and clinical utility. A particular objective of the study is to establish the agreement of ADI-R and ADOS with register-based diagnoses. The latter is of paramount importance for judging the significance and generalizability of findings from large scale register research, which is a specific strength of Swedish science. Instruments: The ADI-R is a clinical diagnostic instrument for assessing ASDs in children, adolescents and adults. The ADI-R provides a diagnostic algorithm for autism as described in both the ICD-10 and DSM-IV-TR and necessary information for making a diagnosis of other ASD in accord with the classification manuals. The ADI-R is appropriate for children and adults with mental ages from about 18 months and above. It is a standardized, semi-structured clinical review for caregivers of children, adolescents and adults. The interview contains 93 items on three content areas: quality of social interaction, communication and language, and repetitive, restricted and stereotyped interests and behavior. The measure also includes other items relevant for treatment planning, such as self-injury and over-activity. Responses are scored by the clinician based on the caregiver's description of the child's behavior. All questions ask about current behavior, with the exception of a few behaviors that only occur during specific age periods. In addition to asking about current behavior, each question focuses on the time period when the behaviors were likely to be most pronounced - generally, between the ages of 4 and 5 years. The interview starts with an introductory question followed by questions about the subject's early development. The next 41 questions cover verbal and nonverbal communication. Questions 50 through 66 ask about social development and play. The next 13 questions deal with interests and behaviors. The final 14 questions ask about ""general behavior,"" including questions about memory skills, motor skills, over-activity and fainting. The ADI-R interview generates scores in each of the three content areas. Elevated scores indicate problematic behavior in a particular area. Scores are based on the clinician's judgment following the caregiver's report of the child's behavior and development. For each item, the clinician gives a score ranging from 0 (not autistic) to 3 (severely autistic). A classification of autism is given when scores in all three content areas of communication, social interaction, and patterns of behavior meet or exceed the specified cutoffs, and onset of the disorder is evident by 36 months of age. For other ASD information from the ADI-R is used informally: e.g. a diagnosis of Asperger syndrome is indicated, if the criteria for autism are fulfilled in face of normal language development, or a diagnosis of PDD-NOS, if social interaction deficits and another behavior domain exceed the cut-offs. This interviewer-based instrument requires substantial training in administration and scoring. A trained clinician can administer the ADI-R to the parent of a child suspected of autism in approximately 2 ½ hours. The ADOS is a semi-structured assessment of communication, social interaction and play or imaginative use of materials for individuals suspected of having autism or other ASD. It consists of four modules (plus a new toddler module), each of which is appropriate for children, adolescents and adults of differing developmental and language levels, ranging from no expressive or receptive language to verbally fluent adults. The ADOS builds on standard activities that allow the examiner to observe the occurrence or non-occurrence of behaviors that have been identified as important to the diagnosis ASDs across developmental levels and chronological ages. The examiner selects the module that is most appropriate for a particular child, adolescent and adult on the basis of his/her expressive language level and chronological age. Structured activities and materials, and less structured interactions, provide standard contexts in which social, communicative and other behaviors relevant to ASDs are observed. In effect, the ADOS provides a 30 to 60 minute observation period during which the examiner presents the individual being assessed with numerous opportunities to exhibit behaviors of interest in the diagnosis of ASD through standard 'presses' for communication and social interaction. Module 1 is intended for individuals who do not consistently use phrase speech Module 2 is intended for individuals with some phrase speech who are not verbally fluent. Module 3 is intended for children for whom playing with toys is age- appropriate who are verbally fluent. Module 4 is intended for verbally fluent adolescents and adults. Though the superficial appearance of the different modules is quite varied, the general principles involving the deliberate variation of the examiner's behavior using a hierarchy of structured and unstructured social behaviors are the same. The standardization of the ADOS lies in the hierarchy of behavior employed by the examiner and the kinds of behaviors taken into account in each activity during the overall ratings. The activities serve to structure the interaction; they are not ends in themselves. The object is not to test specific cognitive abilities or other skills in the activities, but to have tasks that are sufficiently intriguing that the child or adult being assessed will want to participate. What the examiners not do is often as important as what they do. The ADOS is not trivial to administer, so that priori training is advised even for experienced clinicians. The modules consist of between 10 to 15 activities with up to 31 accompanying items to code. Comparable to the ADI-R, items are scored 0 to 3 depending on the presence and severity of observed symptoms. Subsets of items in each module are used to generate diagnostic algorithms for each module. Items and the thresholds for classification of autism and other ASDs differ for each module. In the new diagnostic algorithms, classification is made on the basis of exceeding thresholds for social affect (social and communication domain combined), restricted and repetitive behaviors and a total score of both. Studies on the reliability (e.g. internal consistency, inter rater, retest) and validity (e.g. diagnostic) of the original and many international adaptations of the ADI-R and ADOS have been satisfactory to excellent throughout. For instance, the initial work on the psychometric properties of the English ADI-R showed multi rater weighted Kappas almost exclusively exceeding .65 for all algorithms items, internal consistency ranging from .69 (stereotypies) to .95 (social interaction domain) and item retest reliabilities of mean weighted Kappa = .72. Diagnostic validity studies showed a classification accuracy of 94% compared to clinical expert consensus diagnosis. Comparable data is available for example for the German, Bulgarian, Greek and Dutch versions. The recently presented revised diagnostic algorithms of the ADOS showed sensitivities of >.91 and specificities of >.84 for the discrimination of autism and non-spectrum conditions in N = 1630 individuals with at least some words speech. The diagnostic validity of the new algorithms has been cross-validated and also demonstrated excellent psychometric values in independent cross-cultural studies. Procedure and complementary assessments: Located at the clinical sites or Karolinska Institute Center of Neurodevelopmental Disorders (KIND), we will examine subjects with suspicion of ASD, other mental disorders and typically developing using the ADI-R and the ADOS. Testing for general intellectual abilities will also be carried-out using the Wechsler Intelligence Scales for Children-IV, a multidimensional IQ test-battery to determine general IQ, performance and verbal IQ as well as a profile of intellectual capacities. They comprises core and supplemental subtests forming composite neuropsychological scores. In addition, the Raven matrices are collected, especially to cover ASD cases who show problems with IQ testing using the Wechsler's, e.g. due to low IQ or low verbal skills. Before using the instruments, involved researchers will receive extended training for these scales by the applicant, who is a certificated clinical neuropsychologist and recognized ADI-R and ADOS trainer. Other Swedish trainers for the ADI-R and ADOS (Vivianne Nordin, Eric Zander, Karin Olafsdottir) are included in these assessments. For subsequent inter rater reliability analyses all administrations are videotaped. Up to 10 independent raters skilled on the ADI-R and ADOS, but blind to the children's diagnoses or history, rate these videos in the course of the study. In order to determine retest reliability half of the participants re-examined after three months by an independent examiner. Independent DSM-IV-TR/ICD-10 consensus diagnoses on all participants are established by experienced clinicians (child psychiatrists, clinical child psychologists). Work plan: Study 1: Reliability ADI-R 1. Internal consistency will be calculated for the three ADI-R algorithm behavior domain scales: social interaction, communication, repetitive-stereotyped behavior using Cronbach's alpha. 2. Multirater reliability is determined for the ADI-R between four independent raters for all algorithm items, the three behavior domains and overall diagnosis using % agreement, (weighted) Kappa and Pearson product moment correlation. 3. Retest reliability for the ADI-R is computed for a three-month interval on all algorithm items, the three behavior domains and overall diagnosis using % agreement, (weighted) Kappa and Pearson product moment correlation. Study 2: Reliability ADOS 1. Internal consistency will be calculated for the three ADOS algorithm behavior domain scales: social interaction, communication, repetitive-stereotyped behavior using Cronbach's alpha. 2. ADOS multi-rater reliability is determined between four independent raters for all algorithm items, the three behavior domains and overall diagnosis using % agreement, (weighted) Kappa and Pearson product moment correlation. 3. Retest reliability for the ADOS is computed for a three-month interval on all algorithm items, the three behavior domains and overall diagnosis using % agreement, (weighted) Kappa and Pearson product moment correlation. Significance/patient gain/impact: The value and impact of the study for clinical practice and research on ASD in Sweden have been pointed-out several times before in this application. ASD are no rare disorders, affecting 1% of the general population, causing substantial burden to affected individuals, their families and society. The combined usage of the ADI-R and the ADOS is viewed the gold standard of diagnosing ASD in international child and adolescent psychiatry. They are also valuable tools for intervention and educational planning, and unlike many other scales, continuously updated and improved. Their introduction has been decisive for progress in many fields of basic and applied ASD research. Most guidelines for diagnosing and treating ASD of professional Societies list them as first choice instruments. Both of them have been adapted and successfully evaluated for many languages and cultures. Thus they are considered the best clinical practice scales for ASD. Unfortunately, they have not yet been standardized in Sweden, impeding better clinical practice for patients, the availability of evidence-based instruments for clinicians, and research prerequisites on ASD in Sweden. The present study aims at filling this gap, by broadly establishing reliability and validity of the Swedish translations of the ADI-R and ADOS. In summary, this is a study aiming at a long-term improvement of clinical and scientific structures in Sweden. Its impact will mean enhancing evidence-based clinical practice for patients and experts and a stimulation of internationally competitive ASD research in Sweden. Department/research team: The study is conducted at the Center for Neurodevelopmental Disorders at Karolinska Institutet (KIND), Stockholm, Sweden. KIND is a competence center for research, education and development in child and adolescent psychopathology. KIND's mission is to mutually connect research at KI and clinical services in Stockholm County in order to generate research results of high clinical significance and patient gain.

Two trials are conducted, one a three-armed randomized controlled study, and the second a two-armed randomized control study. Outcomes are measured in terms of changes in problematic alcohol use at follow up 6,12 and 18 weeks after baseline data gathering. Both the Promillekoll and PartyPlanner apps feature real time registration of alcohol consumption and give feedback of estimated blood alcohol concentration levels. PartyPlanner also allows for planning an alcohol consumption event in advance and for later comparison of the plan with actual consumption. Study 1 compares these two apps with a control group. In Study 2, participants reporting alcohol consumption above the weekly recommended level are redirected to randomized assignment to an in-depth app, TeleCoach, which offers different exercises for reducing alcohol use. After 6 weeks the controls are offered the TeleCoach intervention for 6 weeks, and the first intervention group loses app access. In both studies, followup occurs 6, 12 and 18 weeks after baseline registration. Hypotheses: Study 1: 1.

Study 2: The proportion of participants with risky use above recommended levels will decline faster in the group that receives the intervention first, in comparison to controls.","Objectives: This is a composite study consisting of Study 1 and Study 2: Study 1 evaluates the efficacy of two mobile phone applications, Promillekoll and PartyPlanner among university student union members at two or more universities in Sweden. The design is a three-armed randomized controlled trial, and outcomes are measured in terms of changes in problematic alcohol use at followup 6,12 and 18 weeks after baseline data collection. Both Promillekoll and PartyPlanner apps feature real time registration of alcohol consumption and feedback of estimated blood alcohol concentration (eBAC) levels. Both apps show the user when the estimated alcohol level is above 0.6%, a level that can lead to negative health consequences. PartyPlanner additionally provides the possibility of simulating and planning an alcohol consumption event in advance and later on comparing it with consumption at the actual event. Study 2: At the 6 week followup participants reporting an alcohol consumption above the weekly recommended level in Sweden will be redirected into Study 2. They will be asked to stop using any prior app for alcohol use. Half the group will be randomized to the TeleCoach app intervention, which offers the user different exercises for reducing or abstaining from alcohol use, depending on the user's goal (reduction or abstinence). This group will have access to the app for 6 weeks. The other half of the participants will be randomized to a waitlist control group for 6 weeks. Six weeks into the study, the TeleCoach intervention group will lose access to the app, and the waitlist control group will be given access to the TeleCoach app for 6 weeks. All participants (in both Study 1 and Study 2) will be followed up at 6, 12 and 18 weeks from initial baseline recruitment. Method: Study 1:Participants with problematic alcohol use (AUDIT >7 for men and >5 for women), having access to a smartphone running either the Android or the iOs operating systems, are randomized into one of three groups: 1. Access to Promillekoll, 2. Access to PartyPlanner and 3. Waitlist control group (gains access to both apps week 12). Alcohol use outcomes are collected 6,12 and 18 weeks after recruitment to the study. Study 2: At week 6 of Study 1, participants with risky weekly consumption, i.e. over 9 and 14 Swedish standard glasses (Swedish standard glass = 12 g of alcohol) for women and men respectively are randomized into one of two groups: 1. Access to TeleCoach for 6 weeks, followed by 6 weeks without the app. 2. Six weeks as waitlist controls followed by 6 weeks of access to TeleCoach. Alcohol use outcomes are collected 6 and 12 weeks after entering Study 2 (equivalent to 12 and 18 weeks after initial recruitment to Study 1). Students without problematic drinking and/or appropriate smartphones also participate in followups, in order to control for the regression to the mean phenomenon. All students who complete all baseline and followup questionnaires participate in a lottery with the chance of winning one of three computer tablets. Hypotheses: Study 1: 1.

The Short IVR works as an interactive alcohol diary where the user is contacted once a week for four weeks to register their alcohol consumption during the preceding week. The user is given feedback on changes in alcohol consumption compared to last week. The Therapeutic IVR contacts the user once a week for four weeks and is also available for user-initiated calls 24/7 during this four-week period. The Therapeutic IVR allows the user to traverse a menu where the user chooses among listening to vignettes and doing exercises with the purpose of looking at alcohol consumption and exploring ways of coping with it. Method: The design is a three-armed randomized controlled design, and outcomes are measured in terms of changes in problematic alcohol use at follow up six months after study initiation and baseline data gathering. Participants with problematic alcohol use (AUDIT >7 for men and >5 for women) are randomized into one of three groups: 1. Short IVR, 2. Therapeutic IVR and 3. Control group. Outcomes on alcohol use as well as information on the users' satisfaction with the intervention are assessed after 6 months. The primary hypothesis for this study is that having access to one of the two IVR interventions will lead to a greater reduction of problematic alcohol use compared to controls who undergo only screening and follow-up assessment. The secondary hypothesis is that having access to either Short IVR or Therapeutic IVR leads to comparable reductions in risky drinking.",,Interventional,N/A,Randomized,,,Parallel Assignment,,Treatment,Single (Investigator),,Problem Drinking,Behavioral; Behavioral,Short IVR; Therapeutic IVR,,Short IVR; Therapeutic IVR,,,,Inclusion Criteria: - AUDIT >7 for men or AUDIT >5 for women.

Cognitive behavior therapy (CBT) has been shown to be an effective treatment of these disorders. Despite the strong evidence for CBT there is a lack of evidence-based psychological treatment in primary care. For various reasons, the progress of research has not affected clinical practice. For successful implementation of CBT in primary care cost-effective therapies, access to therapists with proper training and supervision, evidence-based manuals and management that support the implementation is needed. Aim: The aim of this trial is to evaluate a stepped care model with CBT in primary care. All patients are first treated with self-help CBT (N = 400). Patients that do not improve after treatment (9 weeks) are randomized to individual CBT or continued self-help treatment. Based on published studies 2/3 is expected to be improved after self-help and therefore do not undergo randomization. 1/3 (n = 133) who didn´t respond to treatment is randomized to individual CBT (N = 67) or continued self-help treatment (N = 67).",,Interventional,Phase 3,Randomized,,,Parallel Assignment,,Treatment,Single (Outcomes Assessor),,Anxiety Disorders; Major Depression; Stress Disorders; Primary Insomnia,Behavioral; Behavioral,Continued self help CBT; Individual CBT,,Continued guided self help CBT; CBT individual therapy,,,,"Inclusion Criteria: - Have an anxiety disorder diagnosis (obsessive compulsive disorder, social phobia, panic disorder, generalized anxiety disorder), or/and major depression, or/and maladaptive stress reaction, or/and primary insomnia Clinician severity rating scale 2-6 Exclusion Criteria: - A higher score than 6 on the Clinician severity rating scale",All,18 Years,65 Years,No,,396,,Absolute improvement in disorder specific symptoms defined as closer to healthy than to clinical population or 2 standard deviations from clinical population; Absolute improvement in disorder specific symptoms defined as closer to healthy than to clinical population or 2 standard deviations from clinical population; Absolute improvement in disorder specific symptoms defined as closer to healthy than to clinical population or 2 standard deviations from clinical population; Absolute improvement in disorder specific symptoms defined as closer to healthy than to clinical population or 2 standard deviations from clinical population,9 weeks; 20 weeks; 26 weeks; 52 weeks,"Absolute improvement, i.e., symptom level below pre-established cut-offs at 9 weeks, 20 weeks, 26 week follow-up, and 52 week follow-up compared to baseline.; Absolute improvement in disorder specific symptoms defined as closer to healthy than to clinical population or 2 standard deviations from clinical population; Absolute improvement in disorder specific symptoms defined as closer to healthy than to clinical population or 2 standard deviations from clinical population; Absolute improvement in disorder specific symptoms defined as closer to healthy than to clinical population or 2 standard deviations from clinical population",Montgomery-Åsberg Depression Rating Scale-Self-report (MADRS-S); Work ability index (WAI); Insomnia Severity Index (ISI); Health Anxiety Inventory (HAI); Perceived Stress Scale (PSS); Trimbos and Institute of Technology Cost Questionnaire for Psychiatry (TIC-P); Quality of Life Inventory (QOLI); EuroQol-5 dimension (EQ5D); Sheehan Disability Scales (SDS); Self-rated health 5 (SRH-5); Obsessive Compulsive Inventory-Revised (OCI-R); Liebowitz Social Anxiety Scale Self-report (LSAS-SR); Panic Disorder Severity Scale Self-rated (PDSS-SR); Penn-State Worry Questionnaire (PSWQ),"Baseline, post-treatment (20 weeks), 26 week follow-up, 52 week follow-up; Baseline, post-treatment (20 weeks), 26 week follow-up, 52 week follow-up; Baseline, post-treatment (20 weeks), 26 week follow-up, 52 week follow-up; Baseline, post-treatment (20 weeks), 26 week follow-up, 52 week follow-up; Baseline, post-treatment (20 weeks), 26 week follow-up, 52 week follow-up; Baseline, post-treatment (20 weeks), 26 week follow-up, 52 week follow-up; Baseline, post-treatment (20 weeks), 26 feel follow-up, 52 week follow-up; Baseline, post-treatment (20 weeks), 26 week follow-up, 52 week follow-up; Baseline, post-treatment (20 weeks), 26 week follow-up, 52 week follow-up; Baseline, post-treatment (20 weeks), 26 week follow-up, 52 week follow-up; Baseline, post-treatment (20 weeks), 26 week follow-up, 52 week follow-up; Baseline, post-treatment (20 weeks), 26 week follow-up, 52 week follow-up; Baseline, post-treatment (20 weeks), 26 week follow-up, 52 week follow-up; Baseline, post-treatment (20 weeks), 26 week follow-up, 52 week follow-up","Change in MADRS-S at post-treatment, 26 week follow-up, and 52 week follow-up; Change in WAI at post-treatment, 26 week follow-up, 52 week follow-up; Change in ISI at post-treatment, 26 week follow-up, and 52 week follow-up; Change in HAI at post-treatment, 26 week follow-up, and 52 week follow-up; Change in PSS at post-treatment, 26 week follow-up, and 52 week follow-up; Change in TIC-P at post-treatment, 26 week follow-up, and 52 week follow-up; Baseline, post-treatment (variable depending on disorder), 26 week follow-up, 52 week follow-up; Change in EQ5D at post-treatment, 26 week follow-up, and 52 week follow-up; Baseline, post-treatment (variable depending on disorder), 26 week follow-up, 52 week follow-up; Change in SRH-5 at post-treatment, 26 week follow-up and 52 week follow-up; Change in OCI-R at post-treatment, 26 week follow-up, and 52 week follow-up.

Post-operative liver failure (PLF) has been identified as a major risk factor leading to increased morbidity and mortality. The incidence of PLF varies largely between 0-30%, and may be accounted for the main reason of postoperative mortality related to liver surgery (reported figures ranging from 18 to 75 %). Currently, there are only a few treatment options for PLF, mainly restricted to the treatment of complications like bile leakage, infections as well as the prevention of further liver damage caused by e.g. thrombosis or haemorrhage as well as administration of liver toxic drugs. Recently the international study group on liver surgery (ISGLS) published criteria for a new definition of PLF which will greatly facilitate the comparison of results from future studies on a variety of aspects on liver failure. ELS by using the Molecular Adsorbent Recirculating System (MARS) is based on a modified haemodialysis that allows the removal of water-soluble and protein bound toxins over an albumin-coated high flux membrane against recycled exogenous albumin. Thus, MARS can support the compromised detoxification capacity of the liver as well as improve physiological parameters. This would offer the potential for temporary support for the harmed liver after liver resection allowing for a more uneventful recovery. For obvious reasons previous reports contain few patients, present heterogonous treatment groups and all suffer from lack of standardized treatment protocols. Few if any surviving patients, thus providing no evidence to encourage ELS as a possible treatment option for patients suffering of PLF. However, studies with defined patient populations and treatments according to a predefined standardised treatment protocol are warranted. Primary issues to be addressed: 1. Can ELS be applied in an early phase of PLF? 2. Is ELS safe and feasible for the treatment of PLF when practised according to a predefined protocol? Secondary issues to be addressed: 1. The development of predictive laboratory-chemical markers of liver failure 2. Indirect measures of portal flow and portal pressure 3. Indocyanine green clearance (ICG) under ELS treatment 4. Clearance of toxic products as assessed in aliquots taken from the dialysate",Primary issues to be addressed 1. Can ELS be applied in an early phase of PLF? 2.

About one-fifth of the adult population and half of the student population are presumed having substantial difficulties due to recurrent procrastination in their everyday life. However, chronic and severe procrastinators seldom receive adequate care due to preconceptions and the lack of understanding regarding procrastination and the treatment interventions that are assumed beneficial. Cognitive behavior therapy is often deemed treatment of choice, although the evidence supporting its use is scarce, and only one randomized controlled trial has been performed. The primary aim of the current study is therefore to test the efficacy of cognitive behavior therapy delivered as either a group intervention or via the Internet. Participants will consist of students recruited through the Student Health Centre at Karolinska Institutet. A randomized controlled trial with a sample size of 100 participants divided into two conditions will be employed; a ten week Internet-based cognitive behavior therapy intervention, and an eight week group intervention based on cognitive behavior therapy. The current study is believed to result in two important findings. First, different interventions inherent in cognitive behavior therapy are assumed to be helpful for people suffering from problems caused by procrastination. Second, both a group intervention and an Internet-based cognitive behavior therapy intervention are presumed suitable for administering treatment for procrastination, which is considered highly important as the availability of adequate care is limited, particularly among students.

Aims: To evaluate to what extent the practitioners acquire and retain MI skills through the different training methods used in the Swedish county councils and municipalities by comparing them with a format that in previous studies has shown to be required for the long-term acquisition of proficiency in MI; training including supervision consisting of feedback based on monitoring of practice. Method: In 2013-2014, 175 practitioners that attend MI training in five different county councils and municipalities in Sweden will be randomized to one of the study's three groups: (a) ""Regular training"" (n= 66), b) ""Regular training"" followed by six individual supervision sessions at monthly intervals based on only the behavior counts component of the Motivational Interviewing Treatment Integrity (MITI) Code (n= 67), and (c) ""Regular training"" followed by supervision based on both the behavior counts and the five global dimensions of the MITI (n= 67). All practitioners will record three sessions: one before "" regular training"", one after ""regular training"" and one six month after training. The practitioners in group b and c will record five additional sessions in conjunction with the supervision. All supervision and recording sessions will be made over the phone with actors role-playing clients. The sessions will be assessed for proficiency in MI by MIC Lab at the Karolinska Institute according to the Swedish translation of MITI 3.1. Time Frame: The specific time points at which the outcome measure (the Swedish version of the MITI, version 3.1.) will be assessed are: 1. Before the county councils' workshop trainings (pre-workshop). 2. Directly after the workshop trainings (post-workshop). 3.

There is a lack of evidence of the best treatment for the patient category. Many patients are sick-listed for long periods of time with different kind of treatment approaches or without any treatment at all. The present study could fill the identified knowledge gap by strengthening of the currently weak scientific evidence for treatment of the patient category. The long-term effects of the study could be to reduce the time for sick leave and improve the rate of patients returning to work and/ or former activity by optimising treatments. Further on, to decrease the number of patients who finally have surgery for their neck problems and thus reducing the mental, physical and social costs.","Patients with cervical radiculopathy have neck- and arm pain, neurological changes, activity limitations and difficulties in returning to work. The current scientific evidence lacks randomised controlled trials to compare surgery with conservative treatment as well as to evaluate different conservative interventions. Most patients are not candidates for surgery and are sick-listed for long time with different treatment approaches or without any treatment at all. The purpose is to evaluate if treatment with neck-specific training and a cognitive behavioral approach improves the outcome compared with prescribed physical activity. Methods: A randomized controlled trial including 144 patients will compare the intervention neck specific training and cognitive behavioural approach with an intervention of prescribed physical activity. The interventions will be led by experienced and specialised physiotherapists and last 14 weeks. Main outcome variable is pain intensity (VAS scale) accompanied with assessments of impairments and subjective health measurements undertaken before intervention and at 3, 6, 12 and 24 months.

NCT02134600,,OmegaChild - Omega-3 Supplementation to Children Now in Full Remission From a Previous Cancer; an Early Phase Dose-finding Study.,20499314; 20211172; 19890019; 16353135,20130321,,7-May-14,,,28-Aug-18,May-14,,2-Sep-16,,Completed,OmegaChild - Omega-3 Supplementation to Children Previously Treated for Cancer,"The purpose of this study is to find an optimal dose of omega-3 that can be given to children who have completed cancer therapy. The future aim is to add omega-3 to conventional cancer treatment modalities and thereby hopefully increase the treatment efficacy, which will have to be addressed in subsequent phase-2 studies.","The rationale for this phase-1 trial is to find an appropriate dose of omega-3 for future phase-2 studies. The investigators aim at defining a dose that can safely be given to children previously treated for cancer, and that does not cause unacceptable side effects. In a longer perspective, randomized control trials are planned where the supplement is given for longer periods of time, and in combination with conventional cancer treatment. In preparation for these trials, this dose finding study was designed that also evaluates compliance. Subsequently the investigators hope that this supplementation can be beneficial for children during both cancer treatment and after remission. The study population consists of children judged to be in complete clinical remission from cancer. In a phase 1 trial, one usually uses healthy individuals as study subjects, but in pediatric studies this is not allowed. Therefore patients who are in full remission were chosen as study objects, but who still come to the clinic for regular follow-ups. This group of patients is relevant for this study since it represents all ages and base-line diets, all kinds of childhood cancers, and because they have suffered from cancer and in many cases still live with the severe consequences of it. The study is designed to give five groups of eight individuals each different doses of omega-3 adjusted to body surface area. The first group starts out on a dose of omega-3 fatty acids that is similar to the generally recommended daily intake for adults (200-400 mg). A dose escalation is then done performed group wise. The highest possible dose in this study (2 x 3000mg/day at dose level 3000 mg/m2 to a child at 1.55 m2, 3871 mg/m2) is still lower than what has previously been given as maximum to children in other studies. The investigators will keep escalating the dose level within the study only as long as no unacceptable side effects are reported. The administration is done orally by drinking 200 mL of omega-3 supplemented fruit juice daily. It has a good fruity taste, low amounts of sugar, and no fish flavour. This should facilitate treatment compliance for the children in particular compared to when omega-3 is given in capsules - the commonest choice in other studies, but less suitable for children. Compliance is important and not further jeopardized by trying to divide the fruit juice in less amounts than the whole package, but the individually prescribed dose as well as the actual amount ingested will be recorded and exact calculations used in the analysis of the study. All study results are primarily evaluated on an intention-to-treat basis, but will also be calculated as treated per protocol and further calculated on the exact dose consumed over 90 days given the compliance in terms of consumed number of fruit juice packages.",Interventional,Phase 1,N/A,,,Single Group Assignment,,Supportive Care,Single (Participant),,Pediatric Cancer,Dietary Supplement,Omega-3 enriched fruit juice,,Omega-3 enriched fruit juice,Nutrifriend by Smartfish AS,,,"Inclusion Criteria: 1. 2-18 years old 2.

Common causes of severe complications in this population are poor nutrition, necrotizing enterocolitis, and severe infections. Feeding intolerance is also a common problem resulting in prolonged need for intravenous lines and poor nutrition. The aim of the study is to evaluate whether supplementation with the probiotic bacterium Lactobacillus reuteri DSM 17938 daily to premature infants with extremely low birth weight increases feeding tolerance to breast milk and thereby improves nutrition, increases growth and reduces serious complications and mortality in this population. Beyond this, possible mechanisms underlying these effects will be analyzed in stool, breast milk and blood samples.","RATIONALE Mortality and incidence of severe complications is still high among extremely premature infants. Common causes of severe complications in this population are poor nutrition, necrotizing enterocolitis (NEC), and severe infections. Feeding intolerance is also a common problem resulting in prolonged need for intravenous lines and poor nutrition. There is scientific evidence that dietary supplements with probiotics may have an effect on these manifestations. Lactobacillus reuteri is a well studied probiotic bacterium that has been tested in several clinical studies in premature infants and older children, and the results of these studies and animal studies suggest that this bacterium may also have an effect on growth and mortality in extremely premature infants. Lactobacillus reuteri reduces colonization with pathogenic microbes, stimulates gastric and intestinal motility and shortens hospital stay in moderately premature infants. In animal models, L. reuteri also induces anti-inflammatory immune responses, reduces the symptoms of inflammatory bowel disease and the incidence of NEC. Administration of L. reuteri also improves the intestinal barrier both in human studies in children and in animal studies. Dietary supplements of L. reuteri to extremely premature infants may therefore improve feeding tolerance and nutrition and reduce the incidence of severe complications in this population. HYPOTHESIS Premature infants with extremely low birth weight receiving daily supplements of Lactobacillus reuteri DSM 17938 will reach full enteral feeding faster compared with children receiving placebo. STUDY DESIGN This study will be conducted as a prospective multi-center double blind placebo-controlled study in neonatal intensive care units in Sweden. In total 134 neonates with extremely low birth weight (<1000g) and gestational age <28+0 weeks will be randomized to receive either dietary supplements of Lactobacillus reuteri or placebo. Study product will be identical to the active and placebo group besides the addition of Lactobacillus reuteri (1.25 x 100 million bacteria=0.2 ml oil drops per day) in the active group. The supplementation will commence within 1-3 days after birth and will be given daily until gestational week 36+0.

Half of the participants will receive methylnaltrexone, while the other half will receive placebo.","The rate of drug absorption in the gastro-intestinal tract is often determined by the rate of gastric emptying. Morphine treatment, which is frequently given in order to relieve pain in patients with STEMI, is known to delay gastric emptying, and has indeed emerged as a predictor of delayed/poor antiplatelet response in patients receiving oral prasugrel or ticagrelor. In recent years, morphine has been found to delay the onset of oral P2Y12-inhibitors. To counteract this, the investigators hypothesized that an opioid antagonist may be used. The opioid antagonist naloxone has previously been shown to reduce the morphine induced delay in gastric emptying However, naloxone crosses the blood-brain barrier (BBB) and reduces the pain relieving effects of morphine. In contrast, the morphine antagonist methylnaltrexone has a reduced passage over the BBB and acts primarily as a peripheral morphine antagonist without affecting the morphine-mediated central analgesic effects. The aim of the planned study is to evaluate whether methylnaltrexone bromide may reduce the morphine induced delay in onset of platelet inhibition after a loading dose of 180 mg ticagrelor in morphine treated patients with STEMI undergoing primary percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI), where a rapid and adequate platelet inhibition after the administration of ticagrelor is crucial. As morphine is an inclusion criterion, all patients included in the study will be on morphine treatment. Thus, morphine treatment is not an intervention to be administered as part of the protocol.

Early detection of prostate cancer has been shown to decrease mortality, but has limitations with low specificity leading to unnecessary biopsies and over-diagnosis of low-risk cancers. The STHLM3 trial has paved the way for improved specificity in early detection of prostate cancer using the blood-based STHLM3 test for identifying men at increased risk of harbouring significant prostate cancer. Targeted prostate biopsies based on MRI images have been shown to increase sensitivity of high-grade cancers compared to the currently used systematic biopsies, but existing evidence are contradictory and not free from methodological flaws. The primary aim of STHLM3-MR/Fusion is to increase the specificity in early detection of prostate cancer without decreasing the sensitivity of aggressive prostate cancers by introducing targeted prostate biopsies and comparing to traditional prostate biopsies. The primary endpoints are the number of performed biopsies and the number of detected high-grade prostate cancers defined as Gleason 7 or higher. Secondary endpoints include the number of low risk prostate cancers diagnosed and the proportion of patients with up-or downgraded disease after assessment of prostatectomy specimen. Additional aims include to assess the health economic consequences of implementing MRI based prostate cancer diagnostics and to improve the quality and effectiveness of prostate cancer diagnosis in the routine health care in Stockholm. The STHLM3-MR/Fusion project will be performed in two separate phases, analyzed separately. Based on power calculations, approximately 500 planned for prostate biopsies will be included in the first phase.

Patients will be followed-up 6 weeks, 6 months and 1 year post-operatively by surgeon and physiotherapist. A low-dosage computer tomography of the thorax will be done after 6 months in order to evaluate healing of the rib cage, possible non-union or dysfunction of osteosynthetic material and measure remaining lung volume. This examination will be compared to the initial computer tomography image done when the patient was admitted. At follow-ups complaints, possible late complications, usage of analgesia and return to work will be recorded. Evaluated instruments, EQ-5D-5L, VAS with Pain-O-Meter (POM) and Disability Rating Index (DRI) will be used to evaluate quality of life, pain and physical function. Range of motion in the thorax, thoracic spine and shoulders will be evaluated for every patient. Breathing movements will be measured by using a Respiratory movement measuring instrument (RMMI, ReMo Inc) and lung function tests will be performed in a standardized manner. In order to enrich the material, hospital data from patients fulfilling the inclusion criteria but not included, at the two study locations, during the inclusion period (June 2014 - June 2017) will be analyzed.

The study wants to investigate whether a new technique to reconstruct the joint between the pancreatic gland and the short bowel can reduce the rate of severe complications after this complex surgical procedure.","Pancreaticoduodenectomy is a complex surgical procedure for radically resecting tumors in the pancreatic head, distal bile duct or duodenum. Postoperative pancreatic fistula is the main contributor of severe postoperative morbidity after pancreaticoduodenectomy. Characteristics of the pancreatic gland like soft pancreatic consistency and small pancreatic main duct predispose for the postoperative fistula development. In high risk patients, the risk of suffering from associated postoperative morbidity is 50 percent which is considered unacceptable high.

The current IBS definition specifies that there are no structural or biochemical abnormalities to account for the symptoms but there is growing evidence that in at least a subset of IBS patients, a discrete immune activation might be a key pathogenetic factor. The condition is prone to develop after a gastroenteritis, post-infectious IBS, and increased numbers of lymphocytes, mast cells and pro-inflammatory cytokines like Interleukin (IL)-1β, IL-6, Tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α and a general increase in mucosal cellularity have been reported. Despite this, the efficacy of anti-inflammatory agents has been poorly investigated. This will be a randomised, double blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-group, multi-centre study that aims to include a total of 200 subjects with irritable bowel syndrome (IBS). All subjects will be randomised to receive either 3x800 mg of mesalazine (Asacol®) or corresponding placebo once daily for a total treatment duration of 8 weeks. Males and females aged 18 to 70 years who already are diagnosed with IBS based on the Rome III diagnostic criteria and with a symptom intensity of at least moderate level; defined as an IBS Severity Scoring System (IBS-SSS) score of ≥175 at both Screening (Visit 1, Day -21±2) and Baseline (Visit 2, Day 0) will be eligible to enter the study. Primary aim: To assess the effect of mesalazine (Asacol®) treatment compared to placebo on global IBS symptoms: A treatment responder will be defined by answering the satisfactory relief of IBS-symptoms question ""yes"" at the end of at least 4 out of of 8 treatment weeks. Secondary aims: To assess mesalazine (Asacol®) treatment compared to placebo regarding: 1.

NCT01458600,,Adjuvant Treatment of Graves´ Ophthalmopathy With NSAID (aGO Study),27099839,2005 02 23,2005-000832-26,19-Oct-11,,,,,,Feb-16,,Completed,Adjuvant Treatment of Graves´ Ophthalmopathy With NSAID (aGO Study),"AGO study - adjuvant treatment, with NSAID, of endocrine ophthalmopathy in Graves´ disease Background - Already at diagnosis of Graves disease approximately 98% of the patients have morphological changes of the retrobulbar tissue concordant with ophthalmopathy. Factors known to induce clinical symptoms of ophthalmopathy are mainly unknown. An interesting observation is that a patient with stable and inactive Graves´ disease developed ophthalmopathy when treated with a glitazone due to diabetes type 2. Glitazones have been shown to increase differentiation of orbital preadipocytes to mature adipocytes. Glitazones are PPAR-gamma agonists and recently diclofenac have been shown to interact with PPAR-gamma in physiological concentrations. Other non-steroidal antiinflammatory drugs, NSAID, like indomethacin lack this effect. In addition, diclofenac inhibit synthesis of prostaglandins which also may be of importance because the natural ligand to PPAR-gamma is prostaglandin J. Inflammation and adipogenesis are hallmarks of the pathological process in Graves ophthalmopathy and NSAID like diclofenac may affect both. There is only one earlier study demonstrating effects of NSAID (indomethacin) in 7 patients with effects on soft tissue symptoms, eye muscle symptoms and eye protrusion. Aim - to investigate if diclofenac can prevent ophthalmopathy and/or progress of ophthalmopathy. Specific aims: 1. To study the frequency of clinical ophthalmopathy in Graves´ disease after 12 months treatment with or without diclofenac. 2. To study the frequency of progress of clinical signs and symptoms in ophthalmopathy after 12 months treatment with or without diclofenac. 3. To study the frequency of optic neuropathy in clinical ophthalmopathy after 12 months treatment with or without diclofenac. Study plan and randomisation - 150 patients with newly diagnosed Graves´disease without ophthalmopathy will be treated with anti-thyroid drugs and L-thyroxin (block and replace) according to clinical routine for 18 months. These patients will be randomized to diclofenac 50 mg twice daily or not for 12 months.","Adjuvant treatment of Graves´ ophthalmopathy with NSAID (aGO study) 1. Background. When performing MRI / CT / ultrasound of the orbital room 98 % of the patients with Graves´ thyrotoxicosis exhibit changes of ophthalmopathy without clinical symptoms of endocrine ophthalmopathy (Burch 1993). Thus, almost all patients with Graves´ disease are at risk to develop clinical ophthalmopathy. Tobacco exposition and treatment with radioiodine ar known factors that trigger ophthalmopathy but other factors are poorly defined. However it is well known that both environmental and genetic factors is of importance because monozygotic twins show a concordance of 20 - 50 %. One interesting observation is a patient with inactive and stable Graves´ ophthalmopathy who developed clinical ophthalmopathy when treated with pioglitazone due to type 2 diabetes (Starkey 2003). One pathogenic mechanism in Graves´ ophthalmopathy is increased orbital adipogenesis and glitazones are known to increase the volume of subcutaneous adipose tissue. Orbital fibroblasts from patients with ophthalmopathy have been shown to differentiate to adipocytes in response to rosiglitazone (Valyasevi 2002). Glitazones are PPAR-gamma agonists and it could be of interest to study effects of PPARgamma antagonists in endocrine ophthalmopathy. Diclofenac has been shown to interact with PPAR-gamma in physiological concentrations and to antagonise PPAR-gamma mediated effects like adipogenesis of the preadipocyte cell line 3T3-L1(Adamsson 2002, Vondrichova 2007). In addition diclofenac is a well-known inhibitor of cyclooxygenases with effects on the synthesis of prostaglandins in for example fibroblasts, lymphocytes and monocytes. The natural ligand for PPAR-gamma is prostaglandin J (Forman 1995). To conclude, NSAID like diclofenac may affect both synthesis of prostaglandins and concomittantly antagonise the effects of the natural ligand to PPAR-gamma, prostaglandin J2. We have recently demonstrated upregulation of immediate early genes, including COX-2, with important functions in adipogenesis in patients with severe ophthalmopathy (Lantz 2005). Previously there is only one study published on treatment of ophthalmopathy with NSAID ,indometacin (Amemia 1982). Although only 7 patients were studied there were effects on soft tissue symptoms, eye protrusion and eye muscle symptoms. Due to the knowledge of retrobulbar morphological changes in patients with Graves´ thyrotoxicosis without clinical ophthalmopathy it may be of importance to interact as early as possible. We therefore plan to start a randomised single-blind study where patients will receive diclofenac for 12 months in parallel with the standard treatment for thyrotoxicosis. 2. Trial design The trial is a multi-center (Malmö and Stockholm), controlled, single-blind design and the subjects are randomised to thyrostatics with and without diclofenac by a body independent from the study The total duration of the study is 24 months with 12 months treatment with or without diclofenac in addition to regular treatment for thyrotoxicosis. The follow up period will be 12 months. Decision of the main treatment of thyrotoxicosis is based on clinical terms according to routines in Malmö and Stockholm and is given according to the protocol of TT96. Patients are randomised for adjuvant therapy with or without diclofenac after choice of main treatment for thyrotoxicosis. 2.1 Monitoring The study will be monitored by a science nurse with formal education in monitoring clinical trials. 3. Objectives The primary objective To find out if diclofenac can prevent development of ophthalmopathy in patients with Graves´ disease. The secondary objectives are: 1. Determine the activity at diagnosis of ophthalmopathy 2. Determine the time from thyrotoxicosis to ophthalmopathy 3. Determine the frequency of patients with corticosteroid requiring ophthalmopathy 3.1 Endpoints The objectives of the trial will be examined by the following endpoints: Efficacy Primary endpoint: The frequency of ophthalmopathy after 24 months as judged by the following clinical signs:. Optic nerve dysfunction 0. No 1. Yes Eye-lid edema 0. No 1. Yes Chemosis 0. No 1. Yes Conjunctival injection 0. No 1. Yes Exophthalmos 0. No 1. Yes Hertel - base right left Eye muscle dysfunction 0. No 1. Yes Corneal ulcers 0. No 1. Yes Summa: Ophthalmopathy is present if the patient has one sign or more. Secondary endpoints: I. Activity of ophthalmopathy as judged by clinical activity score (CAS) Spontaneous retrobulbar pain 0. No 1. Yes Painful eye-movements 0. No 1. Yes Eye-lid erythema 0. No 1. Yes Conjunctival injection 0. No 1. Yes Chemosis 0. No 1. Yes Swollenness of caruncula 0. No 1. Yes Eye-lid edema or swollenness 0. No 1. Yes Sum: II. The time from thyrotoxicosis to ophthalmopathy. III. The frequency of corticosteroid requiring ophthalmopathy. Criteria for start of steroid treatment are: 1. Risk of corneal ulcers with or without exophthalmos 2. Double vision within 30 degrees 3. Optic nerve dysfunction. 3.2 Treatment of subjects All patients that fulfill the inclusion criteria and accept participation in the study will after decision of main treatment for thyrotoxicosis be randomised to treatment with or without diclofenac. Patients will receive diclofenac 50 mg 1x2 for 12 months in addition to standard treatment of thyrotoxicosis according to the following routines. Thyrostatics Patients will receive p.o. methimazole (Thacapzol) 5 mg 3x2 supplemented with L-thyroxine (Euthyrox) after 14 days, initially for the first two weeks 0.5x1, and thereafter 1x1. If the patient react with allergic symptoms to methimazole, treatment is changed to propylthiouracil (Tiotil) 50 mg 3x3. Adjustment of L-thyroxine is done with help of thyroid laboratory parameters (TSH, fT4) and titration after clinical response. The dose of thyrostatics is not reduced and if necessary on demand the dose is increased. If necessary, a beta-blocker is used, primarily propranolol (Inderal) 40 mg 1x1-3 or metoprolol (Seloken) 50 mg 1x1-3 which can be increased depending of patients response. 3.3 Measurement of laboratory parameters All laboratory analyses will be performed at the department of Clinical Chemistry, Malmö University Hospital and at the department of Clinical Chemistry Karolinska University Hospital. 4. Rationale for treatment Adjuvant treatment already at diagnosis of thyrotoxicosis has been chosen in the aim to prevent clinical ophthalmopathy due to the fact that morphological changes of ophthalmopathy in the orbital room exist in Graves´ thyrotoxicosis in up to 98% of the patients without clinical symptoms. The long period of time for treatment with diclofenac is justified by the knowledge that the majority of patients at risk for developing ophthalmopathy exhibit clinical symptoms within 18 months. 5. Subjects 5.1 Number of patients A total of 150 statistically analysable patients (the total number of patients included will be 10% higher to compensate for loss of subjects) , with 75 in each treatment arm will be included in the study. 6.

Before screening the participants have been provided with written information of the trial. The subjects will be informed, orally and in writing of their responsibilities / rights during the trial as well as possible advantages / disadvantages of the trial. Subjects who wish to participate will be asked to sign and date an Informed Consent Form prior to any trial-related activity. Subjects will be allocated a subject number and the following will be performed and recorded: 1. Assessment of inclusion and exclusion criteria 2. Demographic information 3. Thyroid history 4. General physical examination 5. Measurement of body weight 6. Vital signs 7. Blood sampling 8. Pregnancy test will be performed as per judgement of the investigator 9. Concomitant illness and medication. 10. Information and choice of the routine treatments for thyrotoxicosis 11. Actual eye status, performed by an ophthalmologist within 1 week 12. An appointment will be made for visit w0 6.2 Randomization visit, w0 Laboratory data and other information gathered at screening visit is reviewed and the final decision regarding participation in the trial is taken. The subject will now be randomised to adjuvant treatment with or without diclofenac. The randomization procedure will be designed by an independent body. 7. Trial material The trial is not performed in direct collaboration with the drug manufacturers. 9. Statistical considerations The primary evaluation variable is the proportion of present or new cases of endocrine ophthalmopathy. The null-hypothesis is that there is no differences between the two treatment alternatives according to this proportion (H0:pi 1 = pi 2). The number of patients in each group when performing a two-side significance test on the 5% level for different demands on power and different values in the given proportions of the hypothesis is shown in a separate diagram. With 72 patients in each group there is 80 % chance (power) to get significant results if the real difference is 0.2. The hypothesis is tested with Mantel Haenzels test and further analyses performed with logistic regression which take into consideration the effect of prognostic factors.",Interventional,Phase 4,Randomized,,,Parallel Assignment,,Prevention,Single (Outcomes Assessor),,Graves´ Disease,Drug; Drug; Drug; Drug; Drug,Diclofenac; Methimazole; L-thyroxin; Propranolol; Metoprolol,,diclofenac; diclofenac; without diclofenac; diclofenac; without diclofenac; diclofenac; without diclofenac; diclofenac; without diclofenac,T Diclofenac T 50 mg Ratiopharm; Thacapzol (Recip); Euthyrox (Merck); Inderal (AstraZeneca); Seloken (AstraZeneca),,,"Inclusion Criteria: 1.

This is the first time this treatment combination is studied in humans. Samples of blood, urine and tumour tissues will be analysed for molecular biomarkers. These biomarkers may potentially help us in the future in predicting whether a patient will benefit or not from the cancer treatment. The study also aims to investigate if a newer imaging method, called PET-CT (positron emission tomography-computed tomography), at an earlier stage (than a normal CT scan) can identify patients who will benefit from the given treatment.","Objectives - To explore the safety of sorafenib in combination with vinflunine in patients with transitional cell carcinoma of the urothelial tract and to define a recommended phase II dose for this treatment combination - To correlate early tracer 18F-FDG-PET/CT functional imaging readouts with standard RECIST (version 1.1) evaluations with the intention to explore new endpoints for targeted therapy - To find predictive tumour tissue biomarkers for sorafenib/vinflunine treatment - To evaluate serum and urine markers of apoptosis as potential markers of sorafenib/vinflunine treatment Rationale/Goal To evaluate the tolerability and activity of sorafenib combined with vinflunine in patients with advanced or metastatic urothelial cancer. Tumour biopsies will be collected before and after one cycle of therapy. The translational part of this study aims to explore the predictive value of a number of biomarkers related to the targeted properties of sorafenib and presumptive markers for vinflunine treatment.

NCT01789658,,A Randomized Controlled Trial of Cryotherapy for Prevention and Reduction of Severity of Oral Mucositis in Children Undergoing Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation.,31993753,UU-OM-01,,5-Feb-13,,,,,,Oct-16,,Completed,Cryotherapy for Prevention of Oral Mucositis in Children Undergoing Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation,"Oral mucositis (OM) is a common adverse effect of chemotherapy, radiotherapy and conditioning regimens before Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation (HSCT). The aim of this study is to effectiveness of cryotherapy as a prophylactic treatment in children undergoing HSCT.","There is a complex pathobiology behind OM; chemo and radiotherapy affects the mucosa and submucosa causing DNA-strand brakes and generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS). This initiates a cascade of events, among others activation of transcription factors, up-regulation of pro-inflammatory cytokines, and activation of macrophages and proteases leading to tissue injury causing symptoms such as erythema, edema, ulceration, taste perception alterations, and mouth dryness. OM often causes local and systemic infections, fatigue, pain, and difficulties in basal functions such as swallowing (and hence drinking and eating) and talking and reduces patients' psychological well-being. Nearly 90 % of pediatric patients undergoing HSCT are afflicted with OM. In pediatric patients mucositis is reported as one of the most painful and debilitating side effects during cancer treatment.Beyond a significant suffering for the patient it is hence associated with higher costs for health care and increased mortality. The current scientific situation regarding prevention and treatment of OM has been summarized in Cochrane reports showing limited data on adults and practically missing data on children and adolescents. Concluding guidelines from these reports emphasize the need for well conducted randomized controlled trials (RCT's) to evaluate and refine treatments in order to establish evidence based interventions. The use of cryotherapy to prevent oral mucositis in patients who are receiving high-dose chemotherapy as a conditioning agent prior to HSCT continue to show evidence in the adult population. The aim of this study is to compare treatment with cryotherapy (Arm 1)with a standard oral care protocal (Arm 2) ARM 1 Children are instructed to use chew on ice-chips, ingest ice-cream or ice-water during infusion of chemotherapy as part of the conditioning treatment prior to HSCT. Melted ice should be replaced by new as soon as possible. Children receiving a 24-hour infusion are instructed to use cryotherapy for one hour 4 times a day.

The primary outcome measure is number of unplanned surgical procedures. STUDY DESIGN: A prospective randomized multicenter trial. One hundred and twenty patients with breast cancer will be enrolled into the study. Study duration will be two years from time of primary cancer surgery. TRIAL DESIGN This is a randomized controlled multicenter trial, comparing IBR without (group A) and with (group B) the use of ADM. Participants eligible for the study are patients with breast cancer, planned for mastectomy, who wishes IBR with implants. Each participant is individually randomized to either be reconstructed using implants with total submuscular coverage (A) or reconstruction with ADM and partial muscle coverage (B). Method of assigning patients to treatment groups: After signing and dating the informed consent the patient is entered into the study. If all inclusion and none of the exclusion criteria are full filled, the patient will be randomized to group A or group B. TREATMENT/ INTERVENTION The decision and treatment plan advocating mastectomy is based on multi disciplinary conference (MDT), and the diagnosis of invasive or pre-invasive (in situ) breast cancer is made on triple assessment. If the patient wishes to undergo immediate implant based reconstruction, and meets the selection criteria for entering the study, she is randomly selected to be treated according to Group A or Group B. Group A will be reconstructed with expander or anatomical gel implant without ADM, using complete muscle coverage. Group B will be reconstructed with expander or anatomical gel implant using partial muscle coverage in conjunction with ADM. Randomization at enrollment is made with regard to the use of ADM or not, so both expander and direct-to-implant techniques will be utilized in both groups, depending on the quality of skin flaps at time of surgery. RANDOMIZATION TYPE Patients will be allocated to treatment according to permuted block technique. The actual randomization will be performed using computer based system located at Regional Cancer Center (RCC) within Karolinska Institutet. In this system inclusion and exclusion criteria will be automatically checked before patients are randomized to treatment. The randomization process will be stratified for the participating units. STATISTICAL METHODS The main endpoint to be analyzed is the proportion of unplanned reoperations after the initial breast reconstruction. The difference in proportions between the two groups will be presented as a difference in proportion together with a 95% confidence interval. Differences will be tested using Fishers Exact Test. Logistic regression will be used to take into account possible confounding factors. STUDY MANAGEMENT Data recording: The investigators will ensure that all data from patient visits are entered promptly in ink, in the case report forms (CRF). The principal investigator must sign the final CRF page to attest to the accuracy and completeness of the data. The data from the CRFs are then transferred to a database. Monitoring and audit: At periods not exceeding 3 months, centers will be contacted to discuss the progress of the trial, with the purpose to verify CRF data against source records for accuracy of data recording and collection.",Interventional,N/A,Randomized,,,Parallel Assignment,,Treatment,None (Open Label),,Breast Cancer,Procedure; Procedure; Procedure; Procedure; Procedure,Reconstruction with ADM.; Skin or nipple sparing mastectomy; Reconstruction with implant; Total submuscular coverage; Partial submuscular coverage,,Breast reconstruction with ADM; Breast reconstruction with ADM; Breast reconstruction without ADM; Breast reconstruction with ADM; Breast reconstruction without ADM; Breast reconstruction without ADM; Breast reconstruction with ADM,Strattice; ADM; Implant; Immediate breast reconstruction; Acellular dermal matrix; Mastectomy; Breast cancer; Direct-to-implant; Expander; Breast reconstruction; Mastectomy; Skin sparing mastectomy; Nipple sparing mastectomy; Acellular dermal matrix; Immediate breast reconstruction; ADM; Breast cancer; Strattice; Implant; Implant; Mastectomy; Acellular dermal matrix; Direct-to-implant; Immediate breast reconstruction; ADM; Strattice; Breast cancer,,,"Inclusion Criteria: - Patient with invasive or pre-invasive (in situ) breast cancer, planned for immediate breast reconstruction post-skin sparing or nipple sparing mastectomy (unilateral or bilateral) - Patient agrees to participate in study and to sign an informed consent form - Able and willing to return for all scheduled and required study visits Exclusion Criteria: - Is a smoker (patient having quit at least 4 weeks prior surgery can be included) - BMI <18 or > 30 - Previous radiation therapy to the region at any time - Insulin-dependent diabetes or any immune deficiency requiring immunosuppressant use such as cortisone or biological therapies - Predicted implant size <200 or >600 ml per investigator assessment - Allergy to porcine - Pregnancy or lactating - Current enrollment or plans to enroll in another clinical trial unless a retrospective study - Neoadjuvant treatment with chemotherapy",Female,18 Years,N/A,No,,135,,The primary endpoint of this study is number of unplanned/ unanticipated surgical breast procedures.

NCT02497547,,"A Phase 2b, Double-blind, Randomized, Parallel, Placebo-Controlled, Multiple-Dose Study to Evaluate the 12-week Efficacy of Vagitocin in Postmenopausal Women With Symptoms of Vaginal Atrophy",,OXYPEP201,,6-Jul-15,,,,,,Jul-15,,Completed,An Efficacy Study of Vagitocin in Postmenopausal Women With Symptoms of Vaginal Atrophy,"Up to 50% of postmenopausal women frequently suffer from atrophic vaginitis or vaginal atrophy with symptoms including vaginal dryness, irritation, burning, itching or discomfort. Vaginal atrophy is a consequence of the lining tissue of the vagina becoming thinner, drier, and less elastic due to lack of estrogen. In addition, vaginal atrophy is associated with an increased pH, which creates an environment more susceptible to infections. Menopausal hormone therapy is a common treatment for vaginal atrophy. However, menopausal hormone therapy has been shown to coincide with an increased incidence of breast cancer, heart attack and stroke. Some women experience adverse reactions such as uterine bleeding, perineal pain, and breast pain with menopausal hormone therapy. Many women are also reluctant to initiate estrogen treatment, due to a general negative view of menopausal hormone therapy in the society. There are also many contraindicated conditions like undiagnosed vaginal bleeding, thromboembolic disease, breast cancer, other estrogen-sensitive cancers, or liver disease. Women suffering from vaginal atrophy and presenting with these conditions have extremely limited options for effective therapy. Oxytocin is a peptide hormone, normally released into the circulation via the pituitary. Oxytocin has been shown in vitro to exert positive effects on the proliferation of human vaginal mucosal cells from postmenopausal women. Local application of oxytocin, in the form of a vaginal gel, Vagitocin, has been investigated in previous studies on postmenopausal women, as a new effective and safe option for the treatment of vaginal atrophy. Vagitocin appeared to reverse the manifestation of vaginal atrophy by stimulating vaginal mucosal growth, reducing symptoms of vaginal atrophy and increasing the patients' wellbeing and quality of life. Overall, treatment with Vagitocin was safe and well tolerated by the subjects in the studies. In this study, the clinical efficacy of Vagitocin as a potential treatment for postmenopausal women suffering from moderate to severe symptoms of vaginal atrophy, vaginal irritation/itching and vaginal discomfort and/or pain associated with sexual activity will be explored. In addition, the dose relationship and lowest effective dose of Vagitocin will be investigated.",,Interventional,Phase 2,Randomized,,,Parallel Assignment,,Treatment,"Quadruple (Participant, Care Provider, Investigator, Outcomes Assessor)",,Atrophy,Drug; Drug,Oxytocin; Placebo,,Oxytocin 200 IU; Oxytocin 400 IU; Placebo,Vagitocin,,,"Inclusion Criteria: To participate in the study, a subject must: 1.

The evidence that RBC transfusion leads to improved outcome is limited and the intervention may be harmful to some of these patients. In contrast, current guidelines recommend restrictive transfusion of RBC for critical ill patients without septic shock. To bridge the gap between clinical practice and evidence, a large randomised clinical trial is needed to document the efficacy and safety of RBC transfusion in patients with septic shock Design Pragmatic, multicenter, randomised, outcome assessment-blinded trial of patients with septic shock to RBC transfusion at haemoglobin (Hb) transfusion trigger of 7 g/dl (4.4 mM) or 9 g/dl (5.6 mM), stratified by the presence of haematological malignancy and centre. Inclusion and exclusion criteria: To increase the validity of the trial inclusion criteria will be broad with few exclusions Outcome measures The outcome measures will mainly be patient-important but ICU- and hospital length of stay will also be assessed Trial size 2 x 500 patients will be needed to show a 9% absolute risk difference in 90-day mortality (baseline mortality of 45%, relative risk reduction 20% (from septic patients in the TRICC trial), alpha of 0.05 (two-sided) and a beta of 0.20 that is a power of 80% (1-beta). An interim-analysis will be performed after 500 patients. The Data Safety and Monitoring Board (DMSC) will recommend that the trial is stopped if a group-difference in 90-day mortality with p<0.001.

Glomerular filtration rate (GFR) is an index of kidney function that describes the flow of filtered fluid through the kidney. The Chronic Kidney Disease Epidemiology Collaboration (CKD-EPI) equation was used to calculate eGFR. Month 25 is the end of the ITPV.; The time to first occurrence or worsening of hypertension was observed (defined as the need for increased dose of or need for additional anti-hypertensive medication). The numbers presented correspond to the very first occurrence or worsening of hypertension in that treatment group.; The time to first occurrence or worsening of back and/or flank pain was observed (defined as initial onset of polycystic kidney disease [PKD]-related chronic back and/or flank pain; initiation of pain medication treatment for PKD-related chronic back and/or flank pain; addition of a pain medicine for treatment of PKD-related chronic back and/or flank pain; increase in dose of pain medication for treatment of PKD-related chronic back and/or flank pain). The numbers presented correspond to the very first occurrence or worsening of back and/or flank pain in that treatment group.; Gross hematuria is the presence of blood in the urine (defined as pink, red, or cola-colored urine due to the presence of red blood cells). The numbers presented correspond to the very first occurrence of gross hematuria in that treatment group.; Proteinuria is the presence of an excess of serum proteins in the urine, which may be an early sign of kidney disease. The numbers presented correspond to the very first occurrence of proteinuria in that treatment group.; ESRD is when the kidneys permanently fail to work at a level needed for daily life. No participants developed ESRD during the treatment period, therefore the analysis of the onset of ESRD requiring ≥56 days of dialysis was not performed.; A BUN test can reveal how well the kidneys are working by measuring the amount of urea nitrogen in the blood. A high BUN level (>1.3 times the upper limit of normal) may suggest that the kidneys are not working properly. Month 25 is the end of the ITPV.; A SCr test can reveal how well the kidneys are working by measuring the amount of urea nitrogen in the blood. A high SCr level (>1.3 times the upper limit of normal) may suggest that the kidneys are not working properly. Month 25 is the end of the ITPV.; Area under the concentration-time profile from time 0 to time tau, the dosing interval, where tau=24 hours.; Clearance of a drug is a measure of the rate at which a drug is metabolized or eliminated by normal biological processes. Clearance obtained after oral dose (apparent oral clearance) is influenced by the fraction of the dose absorbed. Drug clearance is a quantitative measure of the rate at which a drug substance is removed from the blood.; Volume of distribution is defined as the theoretical volume in which the total amount of drug would need to be uniformly distributed to produce the desired plasma concentration of a drug. Apparent volume of distribution after oral dose (Vz/F) is influenced by the fraction absorbed.; t1/2 is the time measured for the plasma concentration to decrease by one half.; Observed accumulation ratio (Rac) was calculated as AUC from time 0 to 24 hours (Day 15) divided by AUC from time 0 to 24 hours (Day 1).; The KDQoL-36 is a 36-item questionnaire on kidney disease-specific measure of patient-reported quality of life with 5 subscales: physical and mental functioning (items 1-12); burden of kidney disease subscale (items 13-16); symptoms and problems (items 17-28); effects of kidney disease on daily life subscale (items 29-36).

An SAE was an AE resulting in any of the following outcomes or deemed significant for any other reason: death; initial or prolonged inpatient hospitalization; life-threatening experience (immediate risk of dying); persistent or significant disability/incapacity; congenital anomaly. Treatment-emergent are events between first dose of study drug and up to 30 days after last dose that were absent before treatment or that worsened relative to pre-treatment state. AEs included both SAEs and non-SAEs.; The following laboratory parameters were analyzed: hematology (hemoglobin, hematocrit, red blood cell [RBC] count, RBC morphology, platelet count, white blood cell [WBC] count, total neutrophils, eosinophils, monocytes, basophils, lymphocytes); blood chemistry (blood urea nitrogen [BUN], creatinine, glucose, calcium, sodium, potassium, chloride, total bicarbonate, aspartate aminotransferase [AST], alanine aminotransferase [ALT], total bilirubin, alkaline phosphatase, uric acid, albumin, and total protein; urinalysis (pH, glucose, protein, blood, ketones, nitrites, leukocyte esterase, microscopy [if urine dipstick was positive for blood, protein, nitrites or leukocyte esterase]); others (coagulation panel, circulating immune complex, and complement activation).; Vital signs assessment included pulse rate and blood pressure.

The EQ-5D descriptive health profile comprises five dimensions of health (mobility, self-care, usual activities, pain/discomfort, and anxiety/depression). Each dimension has 3 levels of response: No problem (1), some problems (2), and extreme problems (3). A unique EQ-5D health state is defined by combining one level from each of the five dimensions into a single utility index score. EQ-5D index values range from -0.59 to 1.00 where higher EQ-5D scores represent better health status. A positive change from baseline score indicates improvement in health status and better health state.; HRU was defined as any consumption of healthcare resources directly or indirectly related to the treatment of the patient. HRU Analysis may help in evaluating potential costs and budget impact of new treatments from a payer perspective. The rate of inpatient hospitalizations per patient year was calculated as the total number of hospitalizations divided by the total number of patient-years followed in the study period. Patient-years (PY) were calculated as the duration from baseline to last available HRQL assessment for each patient.; A TEAE is any AE occurring or worsening on or after the first treatment of any study drug, and within 30 days after the last dose of the last study drug. Severity grades according to Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events v3.0 (CTCAE) on a 1-5 scale: Grade 1= Mild AE, Grade 2= Moderate AE, Grade 3= Severe AE, Grade 4= Life-threatening or disabling AE, Grade 5=Death related to AE. A serious AE is any AE occurring at any dose that: • Results in death; • Is life-threatening; • Requires or prolongs existing inpatient hospitalization; • Results in persistent or significant disability/incapacity; • Is a congenital anomaly/birth defect; • Constitutes an important medical event.; Renal function was assessed for participants from baseline to the most extreme value in creatinine clearance calculated using the Cockcroft-Gault estimation.; Neutrophil counts was assessed for participants from baseline grade to most extreme severity grade using the NCI CTCAE v 3.0 grading scale.; Hemoglobin was assessed for participants from baseline grade to most extreme severity grade using the NCI CTCAE v 3.0 grading scale.; Improvement in platelets was assessed for participants from baseline grade to most extreme severity grade using the NCI CTCAE v 3.0 grading scale.; Improvement of infection rate by observing historical data compared to the data within clinical database as not analyzed.",,,,"Lenalidomide / Dexamethasone until disease progression; Lenalidomide / Dexamethasone for 18 cycles; Melphalan, Prednisone, and Thalidomide (MPT) for 12 cycles",Experimental; Experimental; Active Comparator,"Lenalidomide plus low-dose dexamethasone given until disease progression; Lenalidomide plus low-dose dexamethasone given for 18 four-week cycles; Combination of Melphalan, Prednisone and Thalidomide given for 12 six-week cycles",newly diagnosed multiple myeloma; Lenalidomide; Revlimid; phase III,"University of AL Birmingham; Cedar Sinai Medical Center Dept of Medicine; University of California, San Francisco- California; Stanford University Stanford; Gainesville Heme Oncology Associates; Baptist Cancer Institute; Integrated Community Oncology Network; Gulf Coast Oncology; Palm Beach Cancer Institute, LLC; Southern Illinois Hematology Oncology; Orchard Healthcare Research, Inc.; John H Stroger Hospital of Cook County; Rush University Medical Center; Ingalls Cancer Institute; Cancer Center of Kansas; Maine Center for Cancer Medicine Blood Disorders; Center for Cancer and Blood Disorders; Mayo Clinic Cancer Center; Billings Clinic; Arena Oncology Associates, PC; Dakota Cancer Institute; Gabrail Cancer Center Research; University Hospitals of Cleveland; Cleveland Clinic; Kaiser Permanente Northwest Oncology Hematology; St. Luke's Hospital and Health Network; University of Pennsylvania; The Cancer Center; University of Tennessee Cancer Institute; University of Texas Medical Branch; Swedish Cancer Institute; Fred Hutchinson Cancer Center; Royal Adelaide Hospital; Peter MacCallum Cancer Centre Divsion of Haematology Medical Oncology; Western Hospital; Frankston Hospital; Flinders Medical Centre; Geelong Hospital; Gosford Hospital; Royal Brisbane and Women's Hospital; Cabrini Hospital; The Royal Melbourne Hospital; Royal Perth Hospital; Gold Coast Hospital; Royal North Shore Hospital; Westmead Hospital; Border Medical Oncology; Wollongong Hospital; Princess Alexandra Hospital; Hospital Leoben; Hospital of Barmherzige Schwestern Linz; Hospital of Elisabethinen Linz; General Hospital Linz; MM-015.

However, to date there is no conclusive evidence from adequately designed and powered trials supporting this practice. Existing data is conflicting and failing to clarify the role of supplemental oxygen in AMI. The DETO2X-AMI trial is designed to shed light on this important issue.","AIM: The aim of the DETO2X-AMI trial is to evaluate the role of supplemental oxygen delivery in the setting of acute coronary syndrome myocardial infarction including ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI), non ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI) and unstable angina (UA). DESIGN: DETO2X-AMI is a multicentre, interventional, controlled, randomized registry based clinical trial (RRCT) recruiting 6600 patients at cardiac care facilities which report into the SWEDEHEART registry throughout the whole of Sweden. The SWEDEHEART (Swedish Web-system for Enhancement and Development of Evidence-based care in Heart disease Evaluated According to Recommended Therapies) registry is a nationwide used platform allowing a broad population of all-comers access to the broad registry network which includes: - RIKS-HIA (nationwide registry where all ischemia cases treated on cardiac intensive care units are registered), - SCAAR (Swedish Coronary Angiography and Angioplasty Registry where nationwide all coronary angiography and percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) procedures are registered)) - SEPHIA (nationwide registry for all post AMI follow-up in patients below 75 years of age). All follow-up will be carried out in SWEDEHEART and other national registries such as the national cause of death register (dödsorsaksregister) or the national patient register (slutenvårdsregister). A similar set-up has been successfully used for the TASTE (Thrombus Aspiration in ST-Elevation myocardial infarction in Scandinavia) trial. MATERIAL and METHODS: Patients with normal oxygen saturation (≥90% on pulse oximeter) presenting to the ambulance service or the emergency department (ED) with classical symptoms suggestive of acute coronary syndrome (ACS) and significant ECG changes or elevated cardiac biomarkers (ED) are evaluated for inclusion. If eligible, oral informed consent is obtained by EMD or ED personnel prior to inclusion. Randomization is carried out on the cardiac intensive care unit using a web-based tool as part of registration directly into the national SWEDEHEART registry. Patients are randomized to either supplemental oxygen delivered by oxymask® (6 L/min) for 12 hours (min 6 hours) or no supplemental O₂. All patients receive standard care according to international ACS guidelines including acute coronary intervention. EFFICACY OUTCOMES: Primary efficacy outcome All-cause mortality at one year in all patients with suspected AMI (ITT). Secondary efficacy outcomes In the ITT population and AMI cohort: - MACE 1: composite of all-cause mortality or rehospitalization with heart failure* - MACE 2: composite of all-cause mortality or rehospitalization with heart failure or readmission with myocardial infarction - rehospitalization with heart failure - rehospitalization with AMI - rehospitalization with shock (Kilip ≥3)* - cardiovascular death * - health economy In the STEMI cohort: MACE as a composite of all-cause death, rehospitalization with MI, cardiogenic shock, or stent thrombosis* plus as above. *These outcomes were specified after the trial had started, but before any treatment comparisons were available. Primary and secondary outcomes will be assessed at 30 days and one year of follow up. Supplementary per-protocol analysis will be performed. Subgroup analyses consist of predefined subgroups including gender, age, AMI/Non-AMI, Type-I AMI ( STEMI/NSTEMI), smokers, Hb, oxygen saturation levels, patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, chronic kidney disease and diabetes mellitus. Two main sub studies will be performed: DETO2X-Biomarkers, a multicenter sub study to the DETO2X-AMI trial assessing if oxygen treatment enhances oxidative stress, systemic inflammation, and markers of apoptosis and MMPs in ACS patients, thereby potentially increasing myocardial damage and cell death, and potentially the prognosis (see separate trial protocol or clinicaltrials.gov NCT02290080 for details). DETO2X-OXYPAIN 2, a multicenter sub study to the DETO2X-AMI trial at centers with catheter laboratories evaluating a possible analgesic effect of oxygen in using visual-analog scale (VAS). Follow-up is carried out according to clinical post AMI routine which includes a standardized registration in the SWEDEHEART registry. Mortality data is obtained from the national cause of death register which is linked to SWEDEHEART. CONCLUSION: There is no conclusive evidence from adequately designed and powered trials supporting the routine administration of supplemental oxygen in the setting of suspected AMI. The DETO2X-AMI trial is designed to shed light on this important issue and give guidance to future recommendations.",Interventional,Phase 3,Randomized,,,Parallel Assignment,,Treatment,None (Open Label),,"Acute Coronary Syndrome; Non-ST Elevation (NSTEMI) Myocardial Infarction; Acute ST Segment Elevation Myocardial Infarction; Angina, Unstable",Drug,Oxygen,,Oxygen,,,,"Inclusion Criteria: - symptoms (chest pain, dyspnea) indicating acute myocardial ischemia within the last 6 hours - ECG changes (ST-segment elevation ≥ 2 mm V1-V4, or ≥ 1 mm in other leads, ST-segment depression >1 mm in any lead, negative T-wave in leads V2-V6, pathological Q-wave in at least 2 adjacent leads), left bundle branch block and/or elevated levels of cardiac troponin levels in the ED indicating acute myocardial ischemia - oxygen saturation ≥90% (pulse oximeter) - age ≥30 Exclusion Criteria: - unwillingness to participate - inability to comprehend given information - continuous oxygen delivery at home prior to inclusion - cardiac arrest prior to inclusion",All,30 Years,N/A,No,,6629,,1-year all-cause mortality,1 year,1-year all-cause mortality on an intention to treat basis (ITT),MACE 1; MACE 2; STEMI-PCI-MACE; Rehospitalization with heart failure; Rehospitalization with AMI; Rehospitalization with shock (Killip ≥3); Cardiovascular death; Health economics,1 year; 1 year; 1 year; 1 year; 1 year; 1 year; 1 year; 1 year,"All-cause mortality or rehospitalization with heart failure at 1-year; All-cause mortality or rehospitalization with heart failure or readmission with myocardial infarction at 1-year; All-cause death or rehospitalization with MI or cardiogenic shock or stent thrombosis at one year; Rehospitalization with heart failure at 1-year; Rehospitalization with AMI at 1-year; Rehospitalization with shock (Killip ≥3) at 1-year; Cardiovascular death at 1-year; Health economics concerning supplemental oxygen treatment from prehospital contact of the emergency service, hospital stay until follow-up 1 year in patients with AMI below 75 years of age",,,,No oxygen; Oxygen,No Intervention; Active Comparator,For patients randomised to withholding oxygen treatment no oxygen is administered at any time as long as the oxygen saturation is ≥90% on pulse oximeter (repetitive checks are performed) all patients receive standard acute coronary syndrome treatment including reperfusion strategies observation duration 12 hours; For patients randomised to oxygen therapy: 6 L/min of oxygen delivered by oxymask® started immediately after inclusion of the ambulance service or in the emergency department given continuously for 6-12 hours (at least 6 hours) all patients receive standard acute coronary syndrome treatment including reperfusion strategies,Acute coronary syndrome; Acute myocardial infarction; Non ST-segment Myocardial Infarction; ST-segment Myocardial Infarction; STEMI; NSTEMI; Oxygen; Unstable angina; Randomised trial; CMR; Mortality; RCRT; RRCT,"Enköping Hospital; Gothenburg University Hospital, Sahlgrenska; Gothenburg University Hospital, Östra; Gävle Hospital; Hallands Hospital Halmstad; Ryhov Hospital Jönköping; Kalmar Regional Hospital; Karlstad Hospital; Kiruna Hospital; Kristianstad Hospital; Köping Hospital; Skaraborgs Hospital Lidköping; Linköping University Hospital; Skåne University Hospital Lund; Skåne University Hospital Malmö; Sahlgrenska Universitetssjukhus Mölndal; Vrinnevi Hospital Norrköping; Norrtälje Hospital; Nyköping Hospital; Skaraborgs Hospital Skövde; St: Göran Hospital; Södersjukhuset; Karolinska University Hospital Huddinge; Karolinska University Hospital Solna; Danderyds Sjukhus; Härnosand Hospital Sundsvall; Trelleborg Hospital; Norrlands University Hospital; Uppsala University Hospital; Hallands Hospital Varberg; Växjö Hospital; Örebro University Hospital; Örnsköldsvik Hospital; Östersund Hospital",Enköping; Gothenburg; Gothenburg; Gävle; Halmstad; Jönköping; Kalmar; Karlstad; Kiruna; Kristianstad; Köping; Lidköping; Linköping; Lund; Malmö; Mölndal; Norrköping; Norrtälje; Nyköping; Skövde; Stockholm; Stockholm; Stockholm; Stockholm; Stockholm; Sundsvall; Trelleborg; Umeå; Uppsala; Varberg; Växjö; Örebro; Örnsköldsvik; Östersund,Sweden; Sweden; Sweden; Sweden; Sweden; Sweden; Sweden; Sweden; Sweden; Sweden; Sweden; Sweden; Sweden; Sweden; Sweden; Sweden; Sweden; Sweden; Sweden; Sweden; Sweden; Sweden; Sweden; Sweden; Sweden; Sweden; Sweden; Sweden; Sweden; Sweden; Sweden; Sweden; Sweden; Sweden,No,No,,,,,,Principal Investigator; Karolinska Institutet; Leif Svensson; Professor of Cardiology,Karolinska Institutet,Other,Swedish Heart Lung Foundation; Swedish Foundation for Strategic Research; The Swedish Research Council,Other; Other; Other,"Leif Svensson, MD, PHD",Study Director,Karolinska Institutet,"Rawles JM, Kenmure AC.

The primary objective is to describe the evolution of circulating hormones involved in feeding and appetite regulation during the 4 first years of life. The secondary objective is to make this blood bank available for other research projects and particularly the investigation of hormones involved in hypogonadism. Over the last ten years, the age at diagnosis in PWS has fallen significantly and the majority of cases is now diagnosed during the 1st trimester of life giving the possibility to collect precise clinical data and serum samples at early stages. The investigators of the project are involved in the care of patients with PWS and have a devoted clinic and an organized network in their country through clinical networks or patient associations.","The investigators propose to perform a prospective multicentric study, both longitudinal (duration 30 months) and cross-sectional with implementation of a blood bank in link with a multicenter database including clinical data on birth, auxology, endocrine functions and feeding behaviour. The cohort will include 200 infants from 3 to 48 months with PWS and 200 controls matched on age recruited in the 6 participating countries. The investigators make the assumption that 3 blood sampling will be necessary during the first year and 6 monthly sampling thereafter. For measuring hormones and neuropeptides (ghrelin, insulin, leptin, pancreatic polypeptide, oxytocin, cortisol, melatonin, orexin A, GLP-1 and PYY) involved in feeding and appetite regulation the investigators will use primarily multiplex microplates technics requiring 50-200µl of sample.

Clearly, encouraging contraceptive use after abortion is a high priority. Long acting reversible contraceptives (LARCs, Implants and intrauterine contraception) are the most effective methods to help women avoid a repeat unwanted pregnancy and abortion. Studies in surgical abortion patients, show that ""quickstart"" of a LARC - i.e., inserting it during the surgical procedure - is associated with substantially greater use of that method six months later than requiring women to return later to get the device. However, today a majority of women chose medical abortion. The clinical routine is to insert LARCs at the follow up 2 to 3 weeks after the abortion treatment. Frequently women choose to do part of the abortion treatment at home and do not return for a follow up.

The efficacy of PledOx will be assessed when added to FOLFOX6 chemotherapy as first line treatment of metastatic colorectal cancer. This study was performed in multiple parts/phases. Part 1 was an open dose-escalation study with the doses 2, 5 and 10 micromol/kg of calmangafodipir. No study outcomes were planned for this part. In part 2a, participants randomly received either Placebo, 2 or 10 micromol/kg of calmangafodipir. In part 2b, participants randomly received either Placebo, 2 or 5 micromol/kg of calmangafodipir. The overall intent of the study was to compare the effect of antioxidant agent PledOx against placebo in one of three different doses/combinations (2 micromol/kg, 5/10 micromol/kg, 2/5/10 micromol/kg vs. placebo, in the first 8 cycles of FOLFOX6 treatment","Globally, nearly 800 000 colorectal cancers are believed to occur annually.

The trial will also study whether a reduced cumulative dosing regimen of glucocorticoids is as effective as a standard disease regimen. The FDA-OOPD is one of the funding sources for this study.,"Granulomatosis with polyangiitis (Wegener's) (WG) and microscopic polyangiitis (MPA) are syndromes of primary systemic vasculitis associated with anti-neutrophil cytoplasm antibodies (ANCA). Together, these syndromes are grouped as ANCA-associated systemic vasculitis (AAV). Plasma exchange, a method of rapidly removing potentially pathogenic ANCA and other mediators of inflammation and coagulation, has shown promise as an adjunctive therapy in AAV to improve early disease control and improve rates of renal recovery in severe disease. Glucocorticoids (steroids) are a standard of care in the treatment of AAV. High doses of glucocorticoids early in disease, although reduce disease activity due to their anti-inflammatory and immunosuppressive properties, also increase the risk of infection, particularly in the elderly and in the presence of uremia. There is no randomized trial data to guide glucocorticoids dosing. Patients with severe new or relapsing AAV and pulmonary hemorrhage and/or renal disease will be eligible for this trial. Subjects participating in this study will be randomized to receive one of the following groups; 1. Plasma exchange - 7 exchanges and, either standard or low-dose glucocorticoids or 2.

NCT00916409,,"A Prospective, Multi-center Trial of NovoTTF-100A Together With Temozolomide Compared to Temozolomide Alone in Patients With Newly Diagnosed GBM.",15126372; 17551011; 18596382; 19387848; 19133110,EF-14,,5-Jun-09,,,10-Apr-17,,,Mar-17,,Completed,Effect of NovoTTF-100A Together With Temozolomide in Newly Diagnosed Glioblastoma Multiforme (GBM),"The study is a prospective, randomly controlled pivotal trial, designed to test the efficacy and safety of a medical device, the NovoTTF-100A, as an adjuvant to the best standard of care in the treatment of newly diagnosed GBM patients. The device is an experimental, portable, battery operated device for chronic administration of alternating electric fields (termed TTFields or TTF) to the region of the malignant tumor, by means of surface, insulated electrode arrays.","PAST CLINICAL EXPERIENCE: The effect of the electric fields generated by the NovoTTF-100A device (TTFields, TTF) has been tested in a large prospective, randomized trial, in recurrent GBM. The outcome of subjects treated with the NovoTTF-100A device was compared to those treated with an effective best standard of care chemotherapy (including bevacizumab). NovoTTF-100A subjects had comparable overall survival to subjects receiving the best available chemotherapy in the US today. Similar results showing comparability of NovoTTF-100A to BSC chemotherapy were seen in all secondary endpoints. Recurrent GBM patients treated with the NovoTTF-100A device in this trial experienced fewer side effects in general, significantly fewer treatment related side effects, and significantly lower gastrointestinal, hematological and infectious adverse events compared to controls. The only device-related adverse events seen were a mild to moderate skin irritation beneath the device electrodes. Finally, quality of life measures were better in NovoTTF-100A subjects as a group when compared to subjects receiving effective best standard of care chemotherapy. In a small scale pilot trial in newly diagnosed GBM patients, the treatment was well tolerated and suggested that NovoTTF-100A may improve time to disease progression and overall survival of newly diagnosed GBM patients. Although the number of patients in the pilot trial was small, The FDA has determined that the data gathered so far warrant testing of NovoTTF-100A treatment as a possible therapy for patients with newly diagnosed GBM. DESCRIPTION OF THE TRIAL: All patients included in this trial are newly diagnosed GBM patients who underwent a biopsy or surgery (with or without Gliadel wafers), followed by radiation therapy in combination with Temozolomide chemotherapy. In addition, all patients must meet all eligibility criteria. Eligible patients will be randomly assigned to one of two groups: 1. Treatment with the NovoTTF-100A device in combination with Temozolomide chemotherapy. 2. Treatment with Temozolomide alone, as the best known standard of care. Patients will be randomized at a 2:1 ratio (2 of every three patients who participate in the trial will be treated with the NovoTTF-100A device). Baseline tests will be performed in patients enrolled in both arms, including specific genetic tests done using tumor samples obtained during their initial surgery. If assigned to the NovoTTF-100A in combination with Temozolomide group, the patients will be treated continuously with the device until second progression. They will also receive temozolomide and possibly a second line treatment that can be one of the following: re-operation, local radiotherapy (gamma-knife), a second line of chemotherapy or a combination of the above. NovoTTF-100A treatment will consist of wearing four electrically insulated electrode arrays on the head. Electrode array placement will require shaving of the scalp before and frequently during the treatment. After an initial short visit to the clinic for training and monitoring, patients will be released to continue treatment at home where they can maintain their regular daily routine. During the trial, regardless of which treatment group the patient was assigned to, he or she will need to return once every month to the clinic where an examination by a physician and a routine laboratory examinations will be done. These routine visits will continue for as long as the patient's disease is not progressing for the second time under the study treatment. If such occurs, patients will need to return once per month for two more months to the clinic for similar follow up examinations. During the visits to the clinic patients will be examined physically and neurologically. Additionally, routine blood tests will be performed. A routine MRI of the head will be performed at baseline and every second month thereafter, until second progression. After this follow up plan, patients will be contacted once per month by telephone to answer basic questions about their health status. SCIENTIFIC BACKGROUND: Electric fields exert forces on electric charges similar to the way a magnet exerts forces on metallic particles within a magnetic field. These forces cause movement and rotation of electrically charged biological building blocks, much like the alignment of metallic particles seen along the lines of force radiating outwards from a magnet. Electric fields can also cause muscles to twitch and if strong enough may heat tissues. TTFields are alternating electric fields of low intensity. This means that they change their direction repetitively many times a second. Since they change direction very rapidly (200 thousand times a second), they do not cause muscles to twitch, nor do they have any effects on other electrically activated tissues in the body (brain, nerves and heart). Since the intensities of TTFields in the body are very low, they do not cause heating. The breakthrough finding made by NovoCure was that finely tuned alternating fields of very low intensity, now termed TTFields (Tumor Treating Fields), cause a significant slowing in the growth of cancer cells. Due to the unique geometric shape of cancer cells when they are multiplying, TTFields cause the building blocks of these cells to move and pile up in such a way that the cells physically explode. In addition, cancer cells also contain miniature building blocks which act as tiny motors in moving essential parts of the cells from place to place. TTFields cause these tiny motors to fall apart since they have a special type of electric charge. As a result of these two effects, cancer tumor growth is slowed and can even reverse after continuous exposure to TTFields. Other cells in the body (normal healthy tissues) are affected much less than cancer cells since they multiply at a much slower rate if at all. In addition TTFields can be directed to a certain part of the body, leaving sensitive areas out of their reach. In conclusion, TTField hold the promise of serving as a brand new cancer treatment with very few side effects and promising affectivity in slowing or reversing this disease.",Interventional,Phase 3,Randomized,,,Parallel Assignment,,Treatment,None (Open Label),,Glioblastoma Multiforme,Device; Drug,NovoTTF-100A device; Temozolomide,,"NovoTTF-100A device in combination with Temozolomide; Temozolomide alone, as the best known standard of care",,,,"Inclusion Criteria: 1.

There will be two groups of patients. 1. The first group (n=167) will receive weight management intervention during up to four months prior to IVF treatment.The group randomized to intervention will start an intensive weight reduction plan. The aim of the weight reduction is to reach as close to normal BMI (<25.0 kg/m2) as possible during a time of approximately 4 months. The purpose of the dietary intervention is to create a negative energy balance to induce weight loss. The intervention starts with 12 weeks of a low calorie liquid formula diet (LCD) and thereafter, diet re-introduction and weight control stabilization until IVF treatment begins. Should the patient for some reason be unable to fulfil the LCD-treatment, she will anyhow have an individualized dietary counselling to help her loose weight until the time for her IVF-treatment. 2. The second group (n=167) will start their IVF-treatment directly without other intervention than written advice about the benefits of weight reduction and exercise. The group randomized directly to IVF-treatment will start the treatment as soon as possible after randomization, preferably within that menstrual cycle. 2. Tertiary aim is a follow-up 2 years after randomization to the study with questionnaires to the couple in both the intervention and the control groups. A special questionnaire will cover the weights of the couple and if the woman has had any pregnancies or live births after concluding the study. For the women having achieved a live birth in the index-cycle of IVF the number of children and also follow-up of the children will be performed by assessing medical records from pediatric clinic (if applicable) and child health care centres covering birth data, general health and weight of the children at birth and at the assessment date.

There have however been a small number of studies which have examined the use of platelets or fluid derived from platelets, either from the patient's own blood or from blood bank products. These have suggested some promise, but have suffered from technical difficulties in making a suitable wound care product or the volume of blood required to derive the product. It is thought that the reason why they may work is that growth factors released by the platelets may stimulate the wound to heal. This study will be a formal, randomised controlled trial to assess a new device for creating a wound care product which is a plug or patch comprising fibrin, white cells and platelets derived from 18 mls of the patients own blood.

During Endoscopic Ultrasound (EUS), tissue samples can be obtained for pathological evaluation with different devices. Fine needle aspiration (FNA) provides a cytological specimen. Unfortunately, in a cytological specimen, inflammatory changes may be undistinguishable from well-differentiated dysplasia. Moreover, for neoplasms such as lymphomas and stromal tumors, tissue architecture and cell morphology are essential for accurate pathological assessment. Therefore, pathologists generally prefer a histological specimen. Fine needle biopsy (FNB) has the advantage of obtaining a histological specimen, which may lead to better diagnostic performance. However, FNB needles are stiffer and more difficult to handle, which can complicate tissue acquisition. In addition, the superiority of histology over cytology in EUS-guided tissue sampling has not been proven yet. For instance, tissue, obtained by FNA and processed with the new cell-block technique, may equal the diagnostic yield of histological tissue cores. A recent meta-analysis suggested that 25G is the optimal FNA needle size to obtain an adequate cytological specimen. In this study, we aim to compare the properties and merits of a newly designed, more flexible, 20G EUS ProCore FNB device to a conventional 25G EUS-FNA device.",Interventional,N/A,Randomized,,,Parallel Assignment,,Diagnostic,Single (Participant),,Pancreatic Masses; Lymph Nodes,Device; Device,25G FNA needle; 20G ProCore FNB needle,,25G FNA needle; 20G ProCore FNB needle,25G Echotip Ultra Fine Needle Aspiration (FNA) device; 20G Echotip ProCore Fine Needle Biopsy (FNB) device,,,Inclusion Criteria: - Patients referred for EUS-guided tissue acquisition because of a (I) pancreatic mass lesion or (II) lymph node - Age > 18 years - Written informed consent - Lesion can be visualized with EUS and is ≥1 cm in size Exclusion Criteria: - Known bleeding disorder that cannot be sufficiently corrected with co-fact or fresh frozen plasma (FFP) - Use of anticoagulants that cannot be discontinued in order to guarantee an INR below 1.5 - Purely cystic lesions - Previous inclusion in the current study - Pregnancy,All,18 Years,100 Years,No,,615,,Diagnostic Accuracy,27 months,"Diagnostic accuracy is the number of correctly diagnosed cases as compared to gold standard diagnosis Gold standard diagnosis is defined as; in operated patients; based on the surgical resection specimen in non-operated patients; based on the conclusions of the diagnostic work-up (combined outcomes of tissue sampling and imaging studies), and confirmed by a compatible clinical disease course of at least 9 months","Number of Participants in Whom Target Lesion Was Sampled; Presence of Vital Target Cells Per Case, Per Needle Type; Number of Patients With Adverse Events Per Needle Type; Diagnostic Yield of the First Needle Pass; On-site Pathological Evaluation Performed",1 day; after 27 months; 27 months after procedure; after 27 months; 27 months,"records if a target lesion was reached during the procedure using the randomised needle or not; Presence of sufficient vital target cells, as in, target organ cells to provide a diagnosis (yes or no); adverse events per needle type, up to 27 months after procedure; Yield is expressed as sample sufficiency for diagnostic analysis by pathologists, this was either sufficient or not; Presence of pathologist on site during procedure",,,,25G FNA needle; 20G ProCore FNB needle,Active Comparator; Active Comparator,"Patients referred for EUS-guided tissue acquisition of a pancreatic mass, lymph node, or other submucosal or undefined mass (non-pancreatic).; Patients referred for EUS-guided tissue acquisition of a pancreatic mass, lymph node, or other submucosal or undefined mass (non-pancreatic).",Diagnostic accuracy; Endoscopic Ultrasound-Guided Fine Needle Aspiration; EUS-FNA; Endoscopic Ultrasound-Guided Fine Needle Biopsy; EUS-FNB; Pancreatic mass; Lymph node,University of California; Yale University School of Medicine; Stony Brook University Hospital; The Royal Adelaide Hospital; University Hospital Leuven; Institut Paoli-Calmettes; Tel Aviv Sourasky Medical Center; Vita Salute San Raffaele University; Catholic University Rome; Kinki University; Erasmus University Medical Center; University Hospital of Santiago de Compostella; Karolinska University Hospital,Irvine; New Haven; New York; Adelaide; Leuven; Marseille; Tel Aviv; Milan; Rome; Osaka-sayama; Rotterdam; Santiago De Compostela; Stockholm,United States; United States; United States; Australia; Belgium; France; Israel; Italy; Italy; Japan; Netherlands; Spain; Sweden,,,,,,,,Sponsor,Foundation for Liver Research,Other,"Cook Ireland, Ltd.",Industry,"Marco J Bruno, MD, PhD; Djuna L Cahen, MD, PhD",Study Chair; Principal Investigator,Erasmus Medical Center; Erasmus Medical Center,,,,,,Study Protocol; Statistical Analysis Plan,No; Yes,"October 13, 2014; October 13, 2014",https://ClinicalTrials.gov/ProvidedDocs/74/NCT02167074/Prot_000.pdf; https://ClinicalTrials.gov/ProvidedDocs/74/NCT02167074/SAP_001.pdf,,,,,<0.05,Chi-squared,Mon Apr 11 14:57:17 2022

NCT01725204,,A Safety and Efficacy Study of Adding Low Dose Pegylated IFN-alpha 2B to Standard Dose Dasatinib in Patients With Newly Diagnosed Chronic Phase Myeloid Leukemia,27133821,NordCML007,2011-005989-38,8-Nov-12,,,25-Sep-17,Sep-12,,May-16,,Completed,Safety and Efficacy of Pegylated IFN-alpha 2B Added to Dasatinib in Newly Diagnosed Chronic Phase Myeloid Leukemia,"Patients with newly diagnosed CML have excellent outcomes with tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKI). However, a few patients will be cured with TKIs alone, and thus need continued life-long treatment. Some patients achieve complete molecular remission (CMR), and this rate is higher with second generation TKIs compared with imatinib. Some experience with drug discontinuation in CMR has been derived from a few small studies, most notably the French STIM study. Approximately 40 % of patients with a minimum of two years in MR4.5 (4.5 log reduction in molecular response) can stop imatinib without relapse, indicating possible cure. To increase the non-relapse rate is of major importance. To achieve a permanent ""cure"" without stem cell transplantation is presently the most relevant goal of clinical studies in CML. The investigators hypothesize that to significantly increase cure rates in CML, therapy should eradicate leukemic stem cells and/or induce or restore anti-CML immunity. Second generation TKIs may have a more profound effect on the stem cell pool as compared to imatinib. This is assessed in our current randomized study with a reduction in leukemic stem cell burden as the primary endpoint (NordCML006). Interferon-alpha (IFN) has a prominent immunomodulatory and antiproliferative mode of action, and has also activity in stem cells. Pegylated IFN in combination with imatinib results in improved therapy responses as compared to imatinib monotherapy. This advantage may translate into higher cure rates. Dasatinib has a unique dual mechanism of action: it is the most potent of available TKIs and induces immunological effects that are different from those of IFN. Both of these drugs may have immunological adverse-effects when used as a monotherapy. However, immunological adverse-effects may also be markers of anti-leukemia efficacy.

Based on a neurological examination, 8 functional systems (visual, brain stem, pyramidal, cerebellar, sensory, bowel & bladder, cerebral, and other functions) are scored from 0 (no disability) to 5 or 6 (more severe disability). Ambulation is assessed based on distance the patient is able to walk, whether assistance is required or restrictions are present. The EDSS score ranges from 0 (normal) to 10 (death due to MS) in 0.5 unit increments. Disability progression is defined by a sustained worsening in EDSS score of 1.0 point or more confirmed after 3 months. Time to onset of disability progression was calculated from the date of first dose to the date of the first visit at which the 1.0 point increase in EDSS was met using Kaplan-Meier methods.

A z-score represents the number of standard deviations a patient's test result is higher (z > 0) or lower (z < 0) than the average test result (z = 0) of the reference population. A positive change indicates improvement.; The MSQOL-54 is a multidimensional health-related QOL measure that combines both generic and MS-specific items into a single instrument. The instrument includes 12 subscales, two summary scores, and two single-item measures. The two summary scores - physical health and mental health - are derived from a weighted combination of scale scores. The physical health composite score includes Physical function, Health perceptions, Energy/fatigue, Role limitations - physical, Pain, Sexual function, Social function, and Health distress. The mental health composite score includes Health distress, Overall quality of life, Emotional well-being, Role limitations - emotional, and Cognitive function. Each composite summary score has a range from 0 to 100 where higher scores indicate better quality of life. A positive change from Baseline indicates improvement.; An adverse event (AE) is any untoward medical occurrence that does not necessarily have a causal relationship with the investigational product (IP). An AE can be any unfavorable or unintended sign, including an abnormal laboratory finding, symptom or disease temporally associated with the use of an IP whether or not considered related to the IP. A serious AE (SAE) is any untoward medical occurrence or effect that results in death, is life-threatening, requires hospitalization or prolongation of existing inpatient hospitalization.

The most frequent symptoms are contamination concerns with consequent washing or concerns about harm to self or others with consequent checking. Although many OCD patients benefit from pharmacotherapy or CBT, between 7% and 10% of OCD patients fail to benefit from these standard treatments and may be considered treatment-resistant with a chronic deteriorating course. The most severely afflicted and disabled of these patients may be indicated for neurosurgical treatments, often considered as a therapy of last resort. Neurosurgical procedures currently used in the treatment of severe, treatment-resistant OCD include anterior cingulotomy, subcaudate tractotomy, limbic leucotomy (which is a combination of the first two procedures) and anterior capsulotomy. The commonality between the different neurosurgical procedures is the irreversible lesioning of bilateral neuroanatomical structures and/or interconnecting pathways that are believed to be involved in the control of affect and limbic function.

However, the optimum fractionation, the timing of surgery and the best use of concomitant chemotherapy remains controversial. There are theoretical reasons to believe that radiotherapy given in larger fractions during a shorter period of time might result in more late side effects than giving a conventional, more protracted RT in patients with rectal cancer. In addition, the optimum timing of surgery after RT, with respect to postoperative morbidity, mortality and potential downsizing of the tumour is not known. To address these questions, a prospective randomized multicenter trial was initiated, the Stockholm III trial, in which patients with primarily resectable rectal cancer were randomized to short-course preoperative RT (5x5 Gy) followed by surgery within one week or after 4-8 weeks or long-course preoperative RT(25x2 Gy) followed by surgery after 4-8 weeks.","840 participants (men and women) with a biopsy verified adenocarcinoma of the rectum scheduled for an open abdominal procedure were enrolled at 18 Swedish Hospitals during 1998-2013. In the initial protocol patients were randomly assigned (1:1:1) between three different RT courses; 5x5 Gy with surgery within 1 week (SRT), 5x5 Gy with surgery after 4-8 weeks (SRT-delay) or 25x2 Gy during 5 weeks without concomitant chemotherapy and surgery after 4-8weeks (LRT-delay). After a protocol amendment on May 21, 1999, participating hospitals could choose to randomise patients to just the short-course radiotherapy arms (1:1) or to all three arms. Randomisation was done by telephone by the Regional Cancer Centre in Stockholm, Sweden, after assessing inclusion and exclusion criteria. Computer generated randomisation lists were constructed by use of permuted block technique (block size of six for the three- arm randomisation, block size of four for the two-arm randomisation) and stratified by participating center. Investigators and patients were not masked to treatment. Follow-up was recommended at 3-, 6- and 12 months after surgery, and yearly thereafter. Although follow-up according to national guidelines with a minimum follow-up at 1 and 3 years was allowed. Patient data was also collected from the Swedish ColoRectal Cancer Register (SCRCR) and medical records. Primary outcome: 1. Time to local recurrence. Secondary outcomes: 1.

A diagnosis of local recurrence was confirmed and reported by the patient-responsible physician to the Swedish ColoRectal Cancer Registry (SCRCR), a nationwide validated national registry. Local recurrence was measured both as first and any event occurring during follow-up (censoring date March 30 2015), when all patients had been followed for at least 2 years.",Number of Participants With Postoperative Complications in Relation to Preoperative Radiotherapy Regimen and Overall Treatment Time.; Tumour Regression Based on the Dworak Grading Scoring System,From surgery until 30 days postoperatively.; At the time of surgery.,"Postoperative complications was defined as any cardiovascular event, infectious, neurological or surgical complications occurring within 30 days after surgery, or during the same hospital admission, validated from medial records. Overall postoperative complication was defined as having at least one postoperative complication. Participants were grouped based on type of preoperative radiotherapy (RT) regimen (eg short- or long course) and overall treatment time (OTT), defined as time between start of RT and surgery. Participants receiving short-course RT were categorised into four different groups; Group A: OTT 7 days, Group B: OTT 8-13 days, Group C: OTT 5-7 weeks, Group D: OTT 8-13 weeks. Participants receiving long-course RT were categorised into two different groups; Group E: OTT 9-11 weeks, Groups F: OTT 12-14 weeks.; Tumour regression (TRG) was assessed using the Dworak grading scoring system, ranging from scores 0 to 4 with higher scores indicating better tumour regression. Definition of scores; 0 = no regression, 1 = dominant tumour mass with obvious fibrosis and/or vasculopathy, 2 = dominantly fibrotic changes with few tumour cells or groups (easy to find), 3 = very few (difficult to find microscopically) tumour cells in fibrotic tissue with or without mucous substance, 4 = no tumour cells, only fibrotic mass (total regression or complete response).

Moreover the poor control of dry weight and sodium/water balance results in increased morbidity. A previous low sodium study and computer simulations show that sodium removal can be improved with a low sodium fluid, which allows achieving a negative sodium balance without altering water balance. The aim of this study is to assess whether treatment with one low sodium bag can substitute for one isotonic glucose bag every day in order to reduce the blood pressure and/or medication for hypertension, defined as the primary endpoint. In order to evaluate the main criteria, blood pressure, a 24hours Ambulatory Blood Pressure Monitoring (ABPM) will be performed twice during the study, at Baseline and at 8 weeks of treatment, according to the EMEA guidance recommendations for anti-hypertensive treatments. In addition, the self measurement of blood pressure will be performed by patients at home during three consecutive days before each visit as well as in case of symptoms of hypotension. The study is designed in three periods: - Run-in period during 1 month: a reference product Gambrosol Trio 40, one bag/ day will be used by all patients. This period is dedicated to train the patient in using of study product, to stabilize the patient in the PD treatment and to randomize the patient, by performing the 24h ABPM. - Efficacy & Safety period during 6 months: each patient will be treated with one of two product : PDsol 12 (studied product) or Gambrosol Trio 40 (reference product) during 6 months. The aim of this period is to evaluate the efficacy and long-term tolerance of new PD fluid. - Follow-up period during 2 months: without treatment. This period is dedicated to ensure the safety of the patients after the study product treatment was stopped and to obtain the information about the reversibility of product effect.",Interventional,Phase 3,Randomized,,,Parallel Assignment,,Treatment,Single (Participant),,Chronic Kidney Failure,Drug,Solution for Peritoneal Dialysis,,Gambrosol trio 40;

The study will consist of 2 parts; Part 1 has a 2-stage design while Part 2 consists of an expansion phase. Subjects will receive intravenous (IV) DARA at 16 mg/kg on the same dosing schedule (weekly [QW], every 2 weeks [Q2W] or every 4 weeks [Q4W] of each 28-day cycle) received on their last prior therapy containing DARA. The dosing schedule for DARA may be adjusted during the course of the study as outlined in the protocol. Subjects will also receive IV DURVA at 1500 mg on Day 2 (Cycle 1) and on Day 1 (Cycles ≥ 2) of each 28-day treatment cycle.","Indication: This study will include subjects that have relapsed and refractory multiple myeloma (RRMM) after treatment with at least 3 prior antimyeloma therapies, including a proteasome inhibitor (PI) and an immunomodulatory drug (IMiD®) or after development of double-refractoriness to a both a PI and an IMiD. The most recent multiple myeloma (MM) treatment regimen should contain daratumumab (DARA) and subjects must have progressed on DARA while on this regimen. Stage 1 A cohort of 18 subjects will be enrolled to determine the preliminary efficacy of DARA plus DURVA. Once the 18 subjects have been enrolled, an interim analysis for futility purpose will be conducted to determine if the study can proceed to Stage 2. Early Safety Monitoring Once 6 subjects have been enrolled and completed the first treatment cycle in Stage 1 of this study, the enrollment continuity would depend on the availability of safety data from the on-going Phase 2 study (MEDI4736-MM-003) of DARA and DURVA in previously DARA-naïve patients. - If MEDI4736-MM-003 safety data are available and the tolerability profile of DARA plus DURVA has been determined to be adequate, then enrollment will continue as planned in Stage 1 without an early safety monitoring review of the data. - If safety data are not available enrollment in this study will be paused for a review of the safety profile of DARA plus DURVA by a Dose Review Team (DRT), using the data from the first 6 patients. - If ≥ 1 of the first 6 patients experiences a dose-limiting toxicity (DLT), the study will be halted for review and a change in the dosing regimen may be implemented. - The DRT will consist of the Celgene Medical Monitor, Celgene lead Safety Physician, Celgene biostatistician, other Celgene functional area representatives, as appropriate, study specific consultants (MD/PhD), and site investigator and/or designees who have enrolled subjects to the study. - All available safety and, if applicable, PK/(pharmacodynamic) Pd, biomarker, and preliminary efficacy data will be reviewed and can be considered in the DRT's decisions. - A DRT meeting will be held to review all data and make decisions regarding continuity of the study. Dose-limiting Toxicity Dose-limiting toxicities (DLTs) may be evaluated during the DLT evaluation period for the initial 6 patients in Part 1 of the study. The DLT evaluation period will be defined as the first treatment cycle. Subjects are considered evaluable for assessment of DLT if they: - Receive at least 1 dose of study treatments and experience a DLT OR - Receive 1 dose of DURVA, 4 doses of DARA and complete the safety follow-up through the end of the DLT evaluation period. Grading of DLTs will be according to the National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (NCI CTCAE) Version 4.03. A DLT will be defined as below: Hematologic DLT 1. Grade 4 neutropenia observed for greater than 5 days duration 2. Grade 3 neutropenia associated with fever (≥ 38.5 °C) of any duration. 3. Grade 4 thrombocytopenia or Grade 3 thrombocytopenia with bleeding, or any requirement for platelets transfusion. 4. Any other Grade 4 hematologic toxicity that does not resolve to subject's pretreatment baseline level within 72 hours 5. Grade 4 anemia, unexplained by underlying disease. Non-hematologic DLT a. Any nonhematological toxicity ≥ Grade 3 except for alopecia and nausea controlled by medical management b. Any treatment interruption greater than 2 weeks due to an AE. While the rules for adjudicating DLTs in the context of dose escalation are specified above, an AE not listed above may be defined as a DLT after consultation with the Sponsor and investigators, based on the emerging safety profile. Stage 2 If 3 or more subjects achieved a response (PR or better) out of the 18 subjects at the end of Stage 1, an additional 32 subjects will be enrolled to evaluate the safety and efficacy of DARA plus DURVA. Part 2: Expansion Upon completion of Part 1, if at least 9 subjects achieve a response (PR or better) out of a total of 50 subjects and it is determined to further confirm the efficacy and safety of DARA plus DURVA, an additional 70 subjects may be enrolled. An Independent Response Adjudication Committee (IRAC) will be set up for this trial to review study data. The IRAC will determine tumor response to therapy and to confirm the time of disease progression (PD) (if disease progressed) at scheduled or unscheduled visits for each subject. The safety and efficacy of the study will be monitored by an independent Data Monitoring Committee (DMC) who are not involved in the trial conduct. The DMC will meet up and review study data at pre specified intervals throughout the trial. In the event that the trial is halted for early safety monitoring, evaluation of the emerging safety data from the initial 6 patients enrolled in Part 1 will be performed by the Dose Review Team (DRT). Safety data will be monitored by the Celgene Medical Monitor and Safety Physician on an ongoing basis throughout the study. Should a significant safety issue be identified, the DMC will be convened to make a recommendation as to the future conduct of the study. The decision to discontinue a subject, which will not be delayed or refused by the Sponsor, remains the responsibility of the treating physician. However, prior to discontinuing a subject, the Investigator may contact the Medical Monitor and forward appropriate supporting documents for review and discussion. The study will be conducted in compliance with the International Council on Harmonisation (ICH) of Technical Requirements for Registration of Pharmaceuticals for Human Use/Good Clinical Practice (GCP) and applicable regulatory requirements.",Interventional,Phase 2,N/A,,,Single Group Assignment,,Treatment,None (Open Label),,Multiple Myeloma,Drug; Drug,DARATUMUMAB; DURVALUMAB,,Administration of Daratumumab (DARA) plus Durvalumab (DURVA); Administration of Daratumumab (DARA) plus Durvalumab (DURVA),DARA; MEDI4736; DURVA,,,"Inclusion Criteria: Subjects must satisfy the following criteria to be enrolled in the study: 1.

Good: Definite pain relief and/or improvement in signs of bleeding starting within 8 hours after an infusion, with at least one additional infusion administered for complete resolution of the bleeding episode;or, Definite pain relief and/or improvement in signs of bleeding starting after 8 hours following infusion, with no additional infusion administered. 3. Moderate: Probable or slight improvement starting after 8 hours following the infusion, with at least one additional infusion administered for complete resolution of the bleeding episode. 4. No Response: No improvement at all between infusions or during the 24-hour interval following an infusion, or condition worsens.; The infusion log diary case report form (CRF) was used to determine the number of on-demand (administration of an unscheduled bolus infusion of Refacto-AF to stop bleeding) ReFacto AF infusions administered to treat a new bleed. This was calculated by adding the initial for a new bleed (on-demand) infusion to any subsequent (on-demand) infusions for the same ""previously treated bleed"" (same bleed with same start date/time).; The number of breakthrough bleeds within 48 hours following a prophylaxis dose of ReFacto AF was summarized. The infusion log diary CRF was used to determine the number of infusions administered to treat a new bleed counting only those infusions which were administered <=48 hours after an infusion marked as ""prophylaxis"" (which had no associated bleed).; The average infusion dose (by weight) for each participant was calculated as his total factor FVIII consumption (in IU) divided by weight (in kg) divided by the number of infusions administered in total study duration. Data was reported separately for participants classified at baseline as following non-prophylaxis regimen (for example: on-demand regimen, preventive, or not specified), and participants classified at baseline following a primary or secondary prophylaxis regimen.; Total factor VIII consumption for each participant was calculated by sum of the total amount of ReFacto AF (in IU) infused for each ReFacto AF infusion (recorded in the infusion log diary CRF). Data was reported separately for participants classified at baseline as following non-prophylaxis regimen (for example: on-demand regimen, preventive, or not specified), and participants classified at baseline following a primary or secondary prophylaxis regimen.; LETE in on-demand setting was based on response to treatment of a bleeding episode. LETE in the on-demand setting occurred if participant recorded 2 successive ""no response"" ratings after 2 successive ReFacto AF infusions. Both infusions were to be administered at an interval of 24 hours for treatment of same bleeding event in absence of confounding factor which included: known presence or subsequent identification of a FVIII inhibitor, known inadequate dose for type and/or severity of bleed in opinion of investigator, delay of greater than 4 hours between onset of bleed to infusion, delay of greater than 24 hours before administration of a follow-up infusion, known compromised ReFacto AF, faulty administration of ReFacto AF, participant had an underlying, predisposing condition responsible for bleed in opinion of investigator (e.g., kidney stones or use of medications known to impair platelet function, such as aspirin or NSAIDs),or ongoing trauma responsible for continued bleeding.; LETE in the prophylaxis setting occurred if there was a spontaneous bleed within 48 hours (<=48 hours) after a regularly scheduled prophylactic dose of ReFacto AF (which was not used to treat a bleed) in the absence of confounding factors. Therefore, LETE in the prophylaxis setting is the occurrence of a bleed. Confounding factors include: Known presence or subsequent identification of a FVIII inhibitor, known inadequate prophylactic dose, known lack of adherence to the prescribed prophylaxis regimen, bleed occurs in a target joint identified at the start of the study, known compromised ReFacto AF, faulty administration of ReFacto AF, an underlying, predisposing condition responsible for the bleed in the opinion of the investigator (e.g., kidney stones or use of medications known to impair platelet function, such as aspirin or NSAIDs) or traumatic injury responsible for bleeding.; LETE in the low recovery setting was defined as lower than expected recovery of FVIII (in the opinion of investigator), following the infusion of ReFacto AF in the absence of confounding factors for the low recovery. The only confounding factors for low recovery are as follows: known presence or subsequent identification of a FVIII inhibitor, known compromised ReFacto AF, faulty administration of ReFacto AF, including inadequate dosing.; Participants who met the dose escalation criteria were prescribed a higher dose and/or more frequent doses as per the investigator's discretion.; AUCinf is the area under the plasma concentration-time profile from time 0 extrapolated to infinite time. It was calculated as International units*hour per milliliter (IU*hr/mL).; AUClast is the area under the plasma versus time curve from time zero to time of last measurable concentration (AUClast); Volume of distribution was defined as the theoretical volume in which the total amount of drug was uniformly distributed to produce the desired blood concentration of a drug. Steady state volume of distribution (Vss) was the apparent volume of distribution at steady-state.; MRT was calculated as AUMCinf / AUCinf-TI/2, where AUMCinf is the area under the first moment curve from time zero to infinity and TI was the duration of infusion.; An adverse event (AE) was any untoward medical occurrence in a participant who received study treatment without regard to possibility of causal relationship. An SAE was an AE resulting in any of the following outcomes or deemed significant for any other reason: death, initial or prolonged inpatient hospitalization, life-threatening experience (immediate risk of dying), persistent or significant disability or incapacity, congenital anomaly.

EXCELLENT: Full relief of pain and cessation of objective signs of bleeding (eg, swelling, tenderness, and decreased range of motion in the case of musculoskeletal hemorrhage) after a single infusion. No additional infusion is required for the control of bleeding. Administration of further infusions to maintain hemostasis would not affect this scoring. GOOD: Definite pain relief and/or improvement in signs of bleeding after a single infusion. Possibly requires more than 1 infusion for complete resolution. FAIR: Probable and/or slight relief of pain and slight improvement in signs of bleeding after a single infusion. Required more than 1 infusion for complete resolution. NONE: No improvement or condition worsens.; Interval between Bleeds in months was calculated as: Observation period for efficacy (in days)/(number of bleeds)*(12/365.2425); Infusions per bleeding episode for maintenance of hemostasis only includes infusions following the resolution of a bleed to maintain hemostasis.; Adverse Events (AEs) and Serious Adverse Events (SAEs); Number of participants who received BAX855, with immunogenicity data from study completion/termination visit. FVIII = factor VIII; PEG-VIII = polyethylene glycol-factor VIII; Anti-CHO = Anti-Chinese hamster ovary; The HAEMO-SYM has two subscales: pain and bleeds. HAEMO-SYM subscale scores are calculated by taking the mean of the items in each subscale and transforming them to a 0 (none or absent) to 100 (very severe) scale. Given that higher scores indicate more severe symptoms on the Haemo-SYM and that the change scores were calculated as the value at study completion minus the value at baseline, a negative change score indicates an improvement (reduction in symptoms). Conversely, a positive change score indicates worsening symptoms.; Change from Baseline to End of Study for SF-36 Questionnaire is provided. Scores for individual SF-36 categories range from 0 to 100 with higher scores representing better health. Given that higher scores indicate better health-related quality of life (HRQoL) and that the change scores were calculated as the value at study completion minus the value at baseline, a negative change score indicates a worsening of HRQoL.; Terminal half-life calculated as log_e2/λz where λz is the terminal elimination rate constant.

It has been demonstrated that insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-1) is one such factor. In utero these biological factors are introduced to the fetus via placental absorption or ingestion from amniotic fluid. Deprivation of such factors is likely to cause inhibition or improper stimulation of important pathways, which in the case of the eye may cause abnormal retinal vascular growth, the hallmark of retinopathy of prematurity (ROP). Retinopathy of prematurity is the major cause of blindness in children in the developed and developing world, despite the availability of current treatment of late-stage ROP. As developing countries provide more neonatal and maternal intensive care, which increases the survival of preterm born infants, the incidence of ROP is increasing. This phase 2 study was originally designed in 3 sections, Sections A, B, and C which are now complete. The protocol was amended and patients enrolled from this point forward will be enrolled into Section D. In Study Section D, a total of 120 subjects (GA of 23 weeks + 0 days to 27 weeks + 6 days) will be randomly assigned with 1:1 allocation ratio to either treatment with rhIGF-1/rhIGFBP-3 or to receive standard neonatal care (Control Group) to obtain at least 80 evaluable subjects. Duration of infusion will last at longest from Study Day 0 (day of birth) up to and including PMA 29 weeks + 6 days, when the subject's endogenous production of IGF-1 is considered sufficient to maintain physiologic serum IGF-1 levels. After discontinuation of study drug infusion, each subject will be followed to PMA 40 weeks ± 4 days.",Interventional,Phase 2,Randomized,,,Parallel Assignment,,Prevention,Single (Outcomes Assessor),,Retinopathy of Prematurity (ROP),Drug,rhIGF-I/rhIGFBP-3,,rhIGF-I/rhIGFBP-3,Mecasermin Rinfabate,,,"Inclusion Criteria: - Signed informed consent from parents/guardians; - Subject must be between GA of 26 weeks + 0 days and 27 weeks + 6 days (Study Section A) or between GA of 23 weeks + 0 days and 27 weeks + 6 days (Study Sections B, C, and D), inclusive Exclusion Criteria: - Subjects born small for gestational age (SGA), ie, body weight at birth <-2 standard deviation score (SDS) (Study Section A only) - Detectable gross malformation - Known or suspected chromosomal abnormality, genetic disorder, or syndrome, according to the Investigator's opinion - Persistent blood glucose level <2.5 mmol/L or >10 mmol/L at Study Day 0 (day of birth) to exclude severe congenital abnormalities of glucose metabolism - Anticipated need of administration of erythropoietin (rhEPO) during treatment with study drug. - Any maternal diabetes requiring insulin during the pregnancy - Clinically significant neurological disease according to the Investigator's opinion(Stage 1 IVH allowed) - Any other condition or therapy that, in the Investigator's opinion, may pose a risk to the subject or interfere with the subject's ability to be compliant with this protocol or interfere with interpretation of results - Monozygotic twins - Subject participating or plans to participate in a clinical study of another investigational study drug",All,N/A,1 Day,No,,121,,Severity of Retinopathy of Prematurity (ROP) as Compared to the Severity of ROP in an Untreated Control Population,End of study,"ROP was measured by central exams with fundus photography.

AUC for the maximum severity of ROP was calculated using the trapezoidal rule. The area between each 2 visits was calculated by multiplying the average of the maximum severities of the 2 visits by the difference in days and analyzed using the van Elteren test. ROP is classified according to the International Classification and is subdivided into 5 stages (1-5) with higher values representing greater severity.; ROP was measured by central exams with fundus photography.

Currently, the standard approach used in most centers to prevent graft-versus-host disease after allogeneic transplantation is based on the combination of a calcineurin inhibitor (cyclosporine or tacrolimus) plus a short course of methotrexate. Unfortunately, this strategy is far from ideal, since the risk of acute GVHD is in the range of 30-40% among patients receiving a matched related donor transplantation and even higher among patients receiving transplantation from an unrelated donor while the incidence of chronic GVHD is 60-70% among patients receiving peripheral blood progenitor cells from either a related or unrelated donor. As far as the patients with multiple myeloma (MM) is concerned, although the development of new drugs has markedly changed the outcome and management of these patients, allogeneic transplantation so far appears to be the only curative option, especially among those patients relapsing after first line treatment. Nevertheless, still new strategies within the allogeneic transplant setting are needed to improve its results. Relapses may occur either extramedullary (very common in this setting) or systemic. In order to reduce the risk of systemic relapses the investigators will use maintenance therapy with Lenalidomide (Len) which, together with bortezomib (Bz) should contribute to eradicate minimal residual disease (MRD). In case the patient do not obtain complete remission or near complete remission after transplant, in addition to the maintenance therapy, the investigators will use four intensification cycles with VRD (Bz-Len-Dexamethasone). In summary, the goal is to optimize the efficacy of allogeneic transplantation by two interventions: one focused on reducing the risk of relapse and the other on reducing the incidence of GVHD.",,Interventional,Phase 1/Phase 2,N/A,,,Single Group Assignment,,Treatment,None (Open Label),,Hematologic Malignancies; Multiple Myeloma,Drug; Drug,Bz (Bortezomib); Len (lenalidomide),,Bortezomib + Lenalidomide; Bortezomib + Lenalidomide,Codenamed PS-341; Marketed as Velcade; Rapamycin; CC-5013; Marketed as Revlimid,,,"Inclusion Criteria: Phase I: For the first 10 patients: - Patients with any haematological malignancy in > CR1 (first complete remission) - Suitable related donor human leukocyte antigen (HLA)identical - Age > 18 and < 70 years For the 10 subsequent patients: - Patients with any haematological malignancy candidates to receive an allogeneic transplant - Suitable related or unrelated donor (a maximum of 1 mismatched is allowed) - Age > 18 and < 70 years phase II trial: - High-risk multiple myeloma patients at first relapse / second complete remission candidates to receive an allogeneic transplantation - Age:> 18 < 70 years. - Suitable donor, related or unrelated (a maximum of 1 mismatched is allowed) - Measurable disease - High risk first relapse is defined as: - First early relapse after Autologous Stem Cell Transplant (ASCT)< 24 months - First late relapses in case the patient does not achieve CR after second ASCT - First relapse in patients with poor cytogenetic features - All subjects must be able to comply with the Lenalidomide Pregnancy Prevention Risk Management Plan.

PD was determined on the basis of investigator assessment with use of RECIST v1.1. PD: at least a 20% increase in the sum of diameters of target lesions, taking as reference the smallest sum of diameters on study (including baseline). In addition to the relative increase of 20%, the sum of diameters had to demonstrate an absolute increase of >/= 5 millimeters (mm).; DOR was defined as the time from first occurrence of a CR or PR, whichever came first, to first documented PD or death, whichever occurred first. Disease progression was determined on the basis of investigator assessment with use of RECIST v1.1. CR: disappearance of all target lesions. PR: At least a 30% decrease in the sum of diameters of all target lesions, taking as reference the baseline sum of diameters, in the absence of CR. PD: at least a 20% increase in the sum of diameters of target lesions, taking as reference the smallest sum of diameters on study (including baseline). In addition to the relative increase of 20%, the sum of diameters must also demonstrate an absolute increase of >/= 5 mm.; An adverse event is any untoward medical occurrence in a participant administered a pharmaceutical product and which does not necessarily have to have a causal relationship with the treatment. An adverse event can therefore be any unfavorable and unintended sign (including an abnormal laboratory finding, for example), symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use of a pharmaceutical product, whether or not considered related to the pharmaceutical product. Preexisting conditions which worsen during a study are also considered as adverse events.; Participants were considered post-baseline ATA positive if they had post-baseline ATAs to Atezolizumab that were treatment-induced or treatment-enhanced. Participants had treatment-induced ATAs if they had a baseline-negative ATA result and developed ATAs at any time after initial drug administration. Participants had treatment-enhanced ATAs if they had a baseline-positive ATA result that showed an enhanced signal that was >/= 0.60 titer units at any time after initial drug initiation.; Cmin was measured for all participants that received at least one dose of Atezolizumab.; ORR was defined as the percentage of participants, who had an objective response. Objective response was defined as either a complete response (CR) or partial response (PR) as determined by the investigator with use of Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors, Version 1.1 (RECIST v1.1). Objective response in this study did not need to be a confirmed response. CR: disappearance of all target lesions. PR: At least a 30% decrease in the sum of diameters of all target lesions, taking as reference the baseline sum of diameters, in the absence of CR. ORR=CR+PR; Cmax was measured for all participants that received at least one dose of Atezolizumab.; The EORTC QLQ-C30 includes five functional scales (physical, role, cognitive, emotional, social); a global health status (GHS)/quality of life (QoL) scale; and items measuring fatigue, pain, nausea and vomiting, dyspnea, appetite loss, sleep disturbance, constipation, diarrhea, and financial difficulties.

Factors expressed by MultiStem cells are believed to reduce inflammation and regulate immune system function, protect damaged or injured cells and tissue, promote formation of new blood vessels, and augment tissue repair and healing. MultiStem cell treatment resulted in significant efficacy in a mouse model of Graft versus Host Disease with almost complete reversal of gastrointestinal pathology (similar to pathology that would be expected in Ulcerative Colitis). These data, together with safety data generated in 2 other clinical trials, suggest that MultiStem has the potential to be a new treatment option for patients with ulcerative colitis.

Sometimes a further response may be achieved by other drugs, mainly other TKIs, which have been explored in different studies but not yet have been approved for clinical use. Pazopanib is a TKI inhibiting the tyrosin kinases KIT, PDGFRA, and VEGF 1-3, all of which have important roles in the pathogenesis of GIST. Theoretically, it may function in GIST, and it deserves investigational trials. The drug is approved for metastatic renal cancer and is relatively well tolerated. In this trial (SSG XXI), the disease control rate (DCR) = (CR+PR+SD) after 12 weeks of treatment will be assessed as the primary endpoint, and at the same time trough levels will be measured. Secondary endpoints include ORR, PFS, toxicity, and disease control rate in relation to trough level week 12 and in relation to the primary mutation of the tumor (if known).

In phase II: Evaluation of progression free survival with treatment with lenalidomide, bendamustine and rituximab","This trial consists of both a phase I portion and a phase II portion. In phase I, the MTD of lenalidomide is determined, starting with 5 mg/day given up to maximally 25 mg/day. In combination with this treatment, bendamustine and rituximab are given at fixed doses. The phase I portion follows a sequential dose escalation, 3+3 design. Initially, three subjects are started treatment with dose regimen 1 (5 mg/day). After the third subject completed two cycles of treatment, if no DLT has occured, the next group of three subjects are treated at the next dose level of lenalidomide (10 mg/day). If one of the three initial subjects experiences a DLT, the cohort is expanded to six subjects. If less than two out of the six subjects experiences a DLT, then the next higher dose group is initiated. If two or more subjects experiences a DLT, no higher dose levels will be tested and the MTD dose has been exceeded. Additional subjects are enrolled at the MTD on the phase II portion of the trial. The above described treatment with lenalidomide, bendamustine and rituximab are given in 6 cycles, cycle length 22 days. Lenalidomide is given day 1-21, bendamustine day 1-2 and rituximab day 1.

NCT00263341,,"A Multicenter, Open-label Study on the Efficacy, Cycle Control and Safety of a Contraceptive Vaginal Ring Delivering a Daily Dose of 150 ug of Nestorone® and 15 ug of Ethinyl Estradiol",30831102,Protocol 300,,6-Dec-05,,,6-Oct-17,,,Aug-14,,Completed,Safety and Efficacy of a Contraceptive Vaginal Ring Delivering Nestorone® and Ethinyl Estradiol,"The purpose of this 1-year study is to evaluate the efficacy and safety of a new contraceptive vaginal ring (CVR) delivering low doses of Nestorone (NES), a new, nonandrogenic progestin, and ethinyl estradiol (EE), an estrogen used in oral contraceptives. The CVR, which is made of silicone rubber, is designed to be used for 1 year (13 menstrual cycles) before replacement is required.","The objective of this study is to evaluate the contraceptive efficacy, cycle control, and safety of a reusable CVR delivering low daily doses of NES and EE for a 1-year (13-cycle) period. Nestorone is a potent, nonandrogenic, 19-norprogesterone derivative, which is not active when given orally, but is highly active when delivered via non-oral delivery systems, such as CVRs, implants, or transdermal preparations. The high potency of NES makes it an excellent candidate for use in contraceptive delivery systems designed to be effective for prolonged periods. This characteristic of Nestorone has been utilized in the design of a contraceptive vaginal ring that releases low daily doses of both NES and EE and is effective for a 1-year (13-cycle) period. The NES/EE vaginal ring is a long-acting contraceptive device, but, unlike other long-term methods, it use is controlled by the woman without the need for medical intervention. The efficacy of NES/EE vaginal ring in preventing pregnancy during a 1-year (13-cycle) period will be studied in women who have regular sexual activity and use no other form of contraception. The Pearl index for all women (18-<40) and Kaplan-Meier life table analyses will be assessed for all subjects and for subjects £ 35 years and will provide supportive analyses for demonstrating efficacy. Pearl indices will be based on all cycles and on all cycles for which back-up contraception is not used. The number of bleeding/spotting days per cycle or reference period will be used to evaluate cycle control. Safety will be evaluated by regular assessments of blood pressure, pulse, and body weight and by laboratory testing and Pap smears at screening and termination, and by the frequencies of adverse events and serious adverse events. Additional safety evaluations will be obtained in a companion Phase 3 study conducted by the NIH (Protocol CCN006) with three substudies to evaluate 1) the effect of treatment on 4 hepatic proteins that may be associated with a risk for thromboembolism; 2) the effect of reusing the same CVR for 13 consecutive cycles on vaginal flora and the risk of infection; and 3) the effect of vaginal delivery of NES and EE on the endometrium.

NCT01817959,,"A Phase 3, Multicenter, Randomized, Double-blind, Parallel Assignment Study to Assess the Efficacy and Safety of Reparixin in Pancreatic Islet Transplantation",32019854,REP0211,2011-006201-10,7-Mar-13,,2-Dec-19,27-Sep-21,,,Dec-17,,Completed,Study to Assess Efficacy & Safety of Reparixin in Pancreatic Islet Transplantation,"The objective of this clinical trial was: - to assess whether Reparixin leads to improved transplant outcome as measured by glycaemic control following intra-hepatic infusion of pancreatic islets in patients with Type 1 diabetes (T1D). The safety of Reparixin in the specific clinical setting was also evaluated. Background: The chemokine CXCL8 plays a key role in the recruitment and activation of polymorphonuclear neutrophils in post-ischemia reperfusion injury after organ transplantation. Reparixin is the first low molecular weight blocker of CXCL8 biological activity in clinical development. Thus, the use of reparixin may emerge as a potential key component in the sequentially integrated approach to immunomodulation and control of non specific inflammatory events surrounding the early phases of pancreatic islet transplantation in T1D patients.","Pancreatic islet transplantation has become a feasible option in the treatment of T1D which offers advantages over whole pancreas transplantation. Several strategies are being evaluated, including anti-TNFα, aimed to prevent early inflammatory events that limit islet engraftment. Among possible mechanisms CXCL8 could play a crucial role in triggering the inflammatory reaction and might represent a relevant therapeutic target to prevent early graft failure. Preliminary data obtained in transplanted patients recruited in the ongoing pilot trial coupled with the safety shown in human phase 1 and 2 studies provide a sound rationale for further development of reparixin in islet transplantation and prompted the conduct of this phase 3 clinical, multicentre, randomised, double-blind, parallel assignment study aimed at assessing the efficacy and safety of reparixin in preventing graft dysfunction after islet transplantation in T1D subjects. At least 42 patients receiving pancreatic islet transplant were involved. Patients might receive up to 2 islet transplants, with the second transplant on average 6 months after the first one. Patients were randomly (2:1) assigned to receive either reparixin or placebo (control group). The Investigational Product was administered as an added on treatment to the immunosuppressant regimen.",Interventional,Phase 3,Randomized,,,Parallel Assignment,,Prevention,"Double (Participant, Investigator)",,Islet Transplantation in Diabetes Mellitus Type 1,Drug; Drug,Reparixin; Placebo,,Reparixin group; Placebo group,REP,,,"Inclusion Criteria: - Ages 18-70 years, inclusive. - Patients eligible for a pancreatic islet transplantation program - Planned intrahepatic islet transplantation alone from a non-living donor with brain death. - Patients willing and able to comply with the protocol procedures for the duration of the study, including scheduled follow-up visits and examinations. - Patients who have given written informed consent, prior to any study-related procedure not part of normal medical care, with the understanding that consent may be withdrawn by the patient at any time without prejudice to their future medical care.
